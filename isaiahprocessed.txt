AUTHOR’S PREFACE
companion to daily Bible reading — and I believe that those
who use it this way will reap the largest rewards from it. This
is not to say that it cannot be used to look up ‘spot’ verses or
passages, for I have done my best not to evade difficulties and, in
every such place, to ask what a reader, Bible in hand, would find most useful to know.
In 1993 IVP were kind enough to publish my larger
commentary, The Prophecy of Isaiah, and it is only fair to say
how this present work compares with that. First, I have felt
comfortable in using again the structured outline of Isaiah which
I worked out for the earlier book. Some reviewers criticized this
or that aspect of my analysis, but, while I promise them that I
have pondered what they wrote, they have not persuaded me to
change my mind. Isaiah does not always stop to put down
markers for us, and we come to his precious text to do the best
we can. I do not see, for example, that I have opted for anything
outrageous in dividing the book after chapter 37 rather than 39.
R. E. Clements, whose approach to Isaiah is very far from mine,
notes that ‘a redactor has quite consciously sought to use these
narratives [i.e. chs. 36 — 39] to form a bridge between the
“Assyrian” background of chs. 1 — 35 and the “Babylonian”
background of chs. 40 — 66, with ch. 39 forming a key transition
unit’ (/saiah 1 — 39, New Century Bible [Eerdmans/Marshalls,
1980], p. 277). I have simply made the ‘bridge’ into a ‘bordercrossing’. Secondly, the majority of the explanatory and expository work
in this commentary is certainly new in expression and quite
considerably new in content. This is as it should be when we are
dealing with the inexhaustible treasure of God’s Word. I have
only very occasionally consciously quoted from The Prophecy of
Isaiah. As ever, I owe a huge debt to Inter-Varsity Press and its
ceaselessly kind director and editors. Even I cannot remember
quite when it was that George Manley invited me to contribute an

I have set out to provide a ‘reader’s commentary’ on Isaiah — a
AUTHOR'S PREFACE
Isaiah commentary to the Tyndale series, so long ago is it! I was
both surprised and delighted when, having presented them with
the larger commentary (for which they had not asked!), and
thinking that surely my chance with the Tyndale series (sadly,
like much else in life) had been frittered away, Frank Entwistle
renewed the invitation. He, like Ronald Inchley before him, has
been a gracious and more than patient friend. It is in order to
enhance my book that I dedicate it to these three, and to the
present editor of the Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries, men
to whom we owe so much. Originally, the plan was for a two-volume commentary and, to
my delight, Derek Kidner had responded positively to my desire
to dedicate volume two to him. I am certainly not going to allow
the absorption of volume two (Is. 38 — 66) into volume one to
deprive me of the pleasure and the honour of having his name
associated with my book — even at the expense of overloading the
now single dedicatory page! I count it a great privilege to forge
this small link with one who is both a great friend and a far
greater and more sensitive contributor than I to the art of Old
Testament commentary.
The completion of the Old Testament Tyndale series, begun
with Derek Kidner’s delightful commentary on Proverbs in 1964,
has been a long time coming and the fault is considerably mine.
Just as God has been pleased to use individual volumes to his
own glory in helping many readers to a fuller and deeper
knowledge of his precious Word, may he now be pleased even
more to use the completed series to that same supreme end!

NOTES
Bible references throughout are to the 1984 edition of the New
International Version, unless indicated otherwise. The lower-case
letters a, b, c, etc., refer to the lines within the verse in question.
The Divine Name. In the Hebrew Old Testament, the personal
name for the God of Israel was denoted by four Hebrew
consonants, usually understood as expressing the form Yahweh.
A strange scruple has, for the most part, prevented translators of
the English Bible from using the Divine Name, adopting the
convention of four upper-case letters, LORD, instead. The form
‘Lord’ represents a Hebrew noun ( “dondy) meaning exactly that.
Inclusio. Developments in our understanding of the structures of
Hebrew poetry (see, e.g., E. R. Follis [ed.], Directions in Biblical
Hebrew Poetry [Sheffield Academic Press, 1986]) have noted the
feature called ‘inclusio’, meaning the ‘bracketing’ of a poem or
stanza by identical words or matching thoughts.
The ‘square root’ sign (Vv) is used as a convenient way of
expressing the root form of Hebrew verbs, e.g. on 4:1, p. 58.

INTRODUCTION
ISAIAH’S MESSAGE
page after page of unbroken print. I offer here in this
Introduction a ‘reader’s review’, an attempt to survey the
wood before examining the trees. Please read this before you
begin to tackle the text, looking up the (by no means exhaustive) references provided en route.
I; is a daunting task for a reader to face sixty-six chapters in
(a) Isaiah 1-5
The account of Isaiah’s call (6:1ff.) provides a convenient
‘marker’, suggesting that chapters 1 — 5 form an introductory unit. As the Commentary shows (pp. 41-66), this turns out to be
a satisfactory observation. In these chapters Isaiah sketches the
situation into which he was called. Their basic theme of
disobedience (1:2-4, 15-16, 19-20; 2:5—9; 3:8-9; 5:7) is placed
between the brackets of hope and no hope: on the one hand, the
Lord has a future for his people (1:26—28; 2:2—-4; 4:2-6), but on
the other, sin must be judged (1:5-6, 24-25; 2:10—11; 3:11). This
latter predominates: chapter 5 contains no note of hope and ends
with a vision of unrelieved darkness (5:29-30).
(b) Isaiah 6 — 12
Opening with the story of a single sinner cleansed (6:5, 7), this
section ends with the song of a saved community (12:1-6).
Within these brackets the section does something characteristic
of the whole Isaianic literature: it takes as its major theme a subtopic from the section preceding. In 1:26 the coming glory of
Zion is anticipated in Davidic terms: David was the first to
occupy Jerusalem (2 Sa. 5:6—9) and things will yet be as they
were ‘at the beginning’, i.e. the days of David come back again.
This Davidic theme is central to chapters 7 — 11. Against the
background of the apostate King Ahaz (7:10—12), the light of the
coming perfect King shines out (7:14; 9:1—7; 11:1-9).
15
ISAIAH
(c) Isaiah 13 — 27
Within the vision of the coming perfect King, a minor theme is
the universal empire over which he would tule (9:7; 11:4, 6-9,
14-16). Is this wishful hyperbole or a solidly grounded hope?
The worldwide, indeed cosmic, panorama of chapters 13 — 27 is
designed to provide the answer. Isaiah 13:9-13, along with 14:1,
sets out the philosophy of history which animates these chapters:
the Lord is the world ruler and when his ‘day’ comes he will
exert his rule alike over heaven and earth, but at the centre of all his operations lies his compassion for his own people. Zion has
this sure place in the Lord’s plans (14:32) and is a refuge for a
troubled world (16:5); its ruler is sometimes David (16:5) and
sometimes the Lord (24:23). The whole series comes to a dramatic climax in the contrast of two cities: the world’s city —
the human attempt to organize the world without God — which
falls (24:10), and the strong city of salvation (26:1) which stands.
(a) Isaiah 28 — 37
Within the world panorama of chapters 13 — 27, the Lord’s final
purpose of ‘one world, one people, one God’ was set out in terms
of the world map as Isaiah knew it: Israel sandwiched between
the would-be superpower, Egypt, and the actual superpower,
Assyria. At the End, the Lord will make them a united, co-equal
whole (19:23—25; 27:11—13). In Isaiah’s time the people of the
tiny puppet kingdom of Judah could well have questioned the
realism of such a hope! In answer to this spoken or unspoken
query, Isaiah moves on into chapters 28 — 37, dealing with an
actual history in which Judah, Egypt and Assyria — the very
nations which formed his eschatological trio — became entangled.
In chapter 28, Jerusalem seems rightly doomed (verse 11), but
the Lord’s cornerstone is there (verse 16) and it remains to be
seen how the divine farmer will deal with his field (verses 23-
29). In fact his purpose is an eleventh-hour deliverance (29:1-8).
The people of Judah have sinfully involved themselves with
Egypt (30:12) and invited the wrath of their overlord Assyria, the unnamed adversary of 30:17. But the supposed strength of Egypt is meaningless (30:7), and a divine purpose long since framed has determined that the Assyrian march against Zion is his funeral procession ending in his funeral pyre (30:33). Chapters 36 — 37 record how all this actually happened (37:36-38).
(e) Isaiah 38 — 55 Chapters 28 — 37 are dominated by the topic of the deliverance of Jerusalem from the Assyrian threat and the proof this offers
16
INTRODUCTION
historically of divine sovereignty in ordering earthly history. But there is a distinct sub-theme: this great deliverance is totally contrary to what Jerusalem’s rulers and people deserve. The same
could be said of chapters 7 — 11 where the coming King is an
unmerited promise but, while that earlier section acknowledged
national sinfulness (e.g. 8:11-12, 19), its major concern was the
sin of the leadership. There is no passage quite like 30:8-17.
Equally, while the great Isaianic title, the Holy One of Israel,
occurs at 10:20, in chapters 28 — 35 it occurs more often than in
the rest of Isaiah 1 — 37 taken together (29:19, 23; 30:11-12, 15;
31:1; 37:23): there has been a specific national rejection of the
Holy God (30:11). There is thus a deeper problem than how
Judah may or may not fare in the power politics of the day. What
about sin and rebellion, rejection of the word of the Lord (28:11-
12) and of the Lord of the word (30:10-11)? This situation
receives pointed illustration in the sin of Hezekiah, detailed in
chapters 38 and 39. To choose security in an alliance with
Merodach-Baladan (39:1—4) was to throw the divine promise of
security and deliverance (38:6) back in God’s face and to
abandon the way of faith. As a result the Lord of history would
use the forces of history in the earthly chastisement of his people
(39:5—7; 42:18-25). Nevertheless, mercy would triumph, and the
comfort of God would come to his people as outlined in 40:1-2:
the ‘period of duress’ (40:2a) would end; Cyrus the Restorer
would send the exiles home and Jerusalem would rise again
(44:28; 45:13; 48:20-22). But also, sin would be covered and
cancelled (40:2b): the Lord’s Servant, the Redeemer, would bring
the people back to God (49: 5-4) by bearing their sins (53:8, 12).
(f) Isaiah 56 — 66 Isaiah foresees that the people will be less than happy to have
Cyrus as their restorer (45:9-11) and it is easy to see why they
felt like this. They were exiled from Jerusalem as a subject
people, dominated by the imperial power of Babylon. To return
home by permission of Cyrus the Persian left their situation
unchanged; they were still subject, still under an imperial power.
David had not returned; there was now not even a puppet king in
Zion; national sovereignty seemed more of a dream than ever! So
when will the Lord’s people really be a free people, free of
worldly influence and oppression? It is to this topic that Isaiah
turns in chapters 56 — 66. The opening is significant: the people
are still awaiting the Lord’s salvation (56:1). But the Lord has his
Agent at the ready: one who will dry his people’s tears (61:1—3),
put an end to their oppressors (62:8) and by himself execute the
17
ISAIAH
great double work of redemption and vengeance (63:1-6). At
last, Jerusalem will be the centre of the New Earth (65:17-25).
ISAIAH’S THOUGHT
It is not an overstatement to say that today the pendulum of
specialist opinion is swinging rapidly away from the older
emphasis on differences within the Isaianic literature and more
towards the great unities which bind it all together. This is not to
say that the specialist world is any nearer to asserting one single author, Isaiah of Jerusalem: far from it. But the rigidity of a first,
second and third Isaiah separated by hundreds of years is giving
way to the thought of an ongoing ‘Isaiah school’, prolonging, enlarging and re-applying the teaching of the master-prophet.'
For, after all, it will not do to impute silliness or carelessness to
the ancient guardians of the written texts who in every other way
give evidence of their extreme caution. We cannot, on the one hand, find them safeguarding the separate integrity of a fragment
like Obadiah, or, as some would say, even inventing a name for
the author of Malachi to guarantee its distinctness, and then, on
the other hand, suppose that, querying what to do with the acme
of Old Testament prophecy, Isaiah 40 — 55, they slotted it in with
Isaiah 1 — 39 because they happened to have half a scroll, or
whatever, to spare! It is a welcome thing to hail the scholarship cae is steadily opening up the streams of unity in the Isaianic
iterature.
(a) History and faith
Isaiah is the Paul of the Old Testament in his teaching that faith
in Sods promises is the single most important reality for the’
Lord’s people: this is the heart of chapters 1 — 37. He is the
‘Hebrews’ of the Old Testament in his proposal of faith as the
sustaining strength of the Lord’s people in life’s dark days: this is
the heart of chapters 38 — 55. He is also the James of the Old
Testament in his insistenc ‘faith works’ ving itself in obedience: thus chapters 56 — 66. Behind all this lies the history through which he lived and future events as he envisaged them.

INTRODUCTION
i. God and history. In 10:5-15 Isaiah teaches how history
‘works’. He sees two fundamental principles. The first is that the
course of history is in the hand of God in the most direct,
managerial sense. The Lord is neither like a boy launching his
model yacht on one side of the pond, confident that the wind will
bring it safely to the other side but uncertain what will happen in
between, nor is he like a chess master patiently allowing the other
player to make moves and then countering his opponent’s
intentions to secure his own victory. For Isaiah, even the superpowers of earth are but rods, axes and saws in the hands of a
single divine Agent (10:5, 15). Secondly, within the divine programme, history is the outworking of moral purposes, the arena of choice and moral responsibility. Thus the Assyrian is held
within the Lord’s purpose to bring due punishment to Jerusalem
(6, 12a): this is the moral government of the world which
underlies the ‘inanimate’ models of rod, axe and saw. Yet the
Assyrian is moved not by obedience to the perceived will of God
but by the arrogance of his own imperialism (7-11, 13-14): he is
out for self-advantage and the fulfilment of proud ambition, no
matter at what expense to others. This makes him culpable before
history’s Ruler and he will be punished (12b). In this way
Isaiah’s view of history is consonant with the Bible’s (especially
the Old Testament’s) fixed gaze beyond second causes to the
First Cause, for preoccupation with second causes leads to living
by our wits, working the system and making the right move,
whereas concentration on the First Cause issues in a life of faith,
trusting, ‘cleaving to the Lord’ (see Acts 11:23, AV), and living
for his pleasure.
The nearest Isaiah comes to offering an illustration of this
understanding of history is in his hint of the horse and the rider
(37:29). All the violent strength lies in the horse; all the
sovereign direction is the rider’s. So it is in the show-jumping
arena where the commentators move easily between congratulating the horse or the rider for a clear round — for there are
two separate even though interlocking ‘forces’ at work. So it is in
history. This is the ‘theology of history’ which made Isaiah the
prophet of faith.
it. The three crises. Crisis one: The unbelieving king. Isaiah
ministered within the fifty-year period between the death of
Uzziah (1:1; 6:1, probably 739 BC), and that of Hezekiah (1:1,
686 BC). This was also the great period of Assyrian imperialism
initiated by Tiglath-Pileser III (Pul, 2 Ki. 15:19) in 745 Bc. The
Palestinian states almost immediately began to feel Assyrian

ISAIAH
pressure under which King Menaham accepted tributary status (2
Ki. 15:19). Pekah, however, who came to the throne by assassinating Menahem’s son (2 Ki. 15:25), was not prepared to
acquiesce in Assyrian overlordship without a struggle. He joined
with Rezin of Aram in a defensive alliance and, for an undeclared
reason, the two moved against Judah. Was this to pressurize
Ahaz of Judah into joining the alliance, making it the cohesive
strategy of all the west Palestinian states, or was it a punitive
measure because Ahaz, foreseeing that Assyria would act against
Aram and Ephraim, was already himself negotiating with Assyria! to secure his immunity when the attack came?* Whatever the truth about this matter, Isaiah’s concern was how Ahaz proposed to react to the northern threat. Isaiah 7:1-17 reviews the crisis, focusing on Isaiah’s call to
faith and Ahaz’ refusal of that call. Faith meant taking no action
in relation to the northern threat (7:4), simply resting on the word
of divine promise (7:7), but the alternative to faith was made
clear (7:9): there is no other way of security or of continuance.
Ahaz, however, refused the way of faith (7:10-17), choosing
rather to buy Assyrian protection (2 Ki. 16:5—9) and thereby, in
J. N. Oswalt’s memorable phrase, acting like a mouse asking a
cat to help it against another cat! Short-term benefit was purchased (as Isaiah foresaw) dearly. In every real sense the Davidic
monarchy ended with Ahaz, for the remaining kings reigned only
as puppets by courtesy of either Assyria or Babylon, and with the
exile (586 BC) the monarchy disappeared and no king ever again
reigned in Zion. When the Lord makes promises, faith is the
make-or-break decision of his people.
Crisis two: The faithful Lord. By the time of Hezekiah
Palestine was in the Assyrian grip: Damascus fell to TiglathPileser in 732 Bc. Shalmaneser succeeded in 727 BC, made his
eastern empire secure by 724 BC and tumed his attention
westward. He began the siege of Samaria, but its fall in 721 BC is
accredited to Sargon. As always in those ancient conglomerate
empires, Sargon’s accession was greeted by widespread rebellion
of subject peoples and he spent his first seven years quieting his eastern and northern dominions. This gave Hezekiah and the Jerusalem politicians a breathing-space in which to review their
1See J. N. Oswalt, The Book of Isaiah, 1 — 39, New International Commentary on the Old Testament (Eerdmans, 1986), pp. 6-7. 2 There were two incursions from the north into Judah. In the first (2 Ch. 28:5-8; Is. 7:1), in spite of successes, the invaders did not proceed against Jerusalem itself. The second wave of invasion (2 Ch. 28:17-18, ‘again’) included Edomite and Philistine incursions.

INTRODUCTION
policy vis-d-vis Assyria. And Egypt was at hand making
encouraging pledges of support should the Palestinian states
revolt. Some of them did so in 715 BC, and it is an interesting
comment on Egyptian promises that, when Sargon took Ashdod
(714 Bc) and its king fled to Egypt, the Egyptians promptly handed him back to Assyria!
Hezekiah seems not to have been involved in this insurgence,
since he was not included in Assyrian reprisals, but, sadly, his
day was to come. 2 Kings 18:7 simply says he rebelled against
the king of Assyria, but behind that bald statement lies a strange
infatuation with Egypt, reviewed by Isaiah in chapters 28 — 35.
The unreliability of Egypt fully justified Isaiah’s irony (30:3—7),
and he was absolutely right in deriding the politicians, jubilant
over their ‘coup’, because in their Egyptian alliance they had
succeeded only in signing their own death warrant (28:14-15)!
He saw that the issue (as in the days of Ahaz) was not one of
political astuteness but of faith. He had faced them with the word
of God in such a simple form that they mocked it as kid’s stuff
(28:9); he reminded them of the solid rock of the Lord’s promises
to David, the foundation stone laid in Zion (28:16), but they
would not build on it; he called them to repentance, rest, quietness and trust as the way of salvation and (warrior) strength
(30:15) but they chose the world’s militarism (30:16). The
message is the same as to Ahaz, and the situation not vastly different, except that Ahaz chose to seek security in a contemporary
killer, Assyria, while Hezekiah trusted the ancestral specialist in
ethnic cleansing (Ex. 1:22). Only the Lord is the life-giver, and
pan alone is the way of life; every other remedy is the way of
death.
Sennacherib acceded in 705 BC, and by 701 BC he had all
Palestine at his mercy and Hezekiah belatedly conscious of his
folly (37:1-3).' Hezekiah, however, discovered the truth that ‘if
we are faithless, he will remain faithful’ (2 Tim. 2:13). Faith is a
potent force, not because of any reflex effect it has within the
human psyche but because it reaches out to a trustworthy Object.
Isaiah had long since known that Assyria would (so to speak)
meet its Waterloo in Judah (14:24—27); in the thick of the crisis
he reiterated the same message (37:21—29); and in the event so it
was (37:36). Judah was delivered just as Isaiah forecast, by an
eleventh-hour intervention (29:1—-8), and, in fact, with this the
zenith of Assyrian power passed. Crisis three: The decisiveness of unbelief: The great

ISAIAH
deliverance (37:36) must have been a bitter-sweet experience for
Hezekiah. It would have been very strange if he had not found
himself saying, ‘If only’! For within the series of events leading
up to the Egyptian Alliance and Sennacherib’s ferocious reaction,
there had happened, within the secrecy of the palace, a personal
crisis of faith for the king which was the hinge on which the
national future turned. When we realize that before Sennacherib
invaded — probably even before he came to the throne — Hezekiah
had decisively turned from trusting the Lord to self-trust and worldly-trust, we appreciate how marvellous is the faithfulness of
God who nevertheless intervened to shatter Assyria in the
mountains of Judah (14:25) — not because the king trusted the promise, not because he merited deliverance, but simply because
it is impossible for the Lord to pledge his word and then go back
on it. The tale of Hezekiah’s crisis is simply told. MerodachBaladan of Babylon was a superb ‘freedom-fighter’, determined
to end Assyrian rule. He achieved this for the first time, ruling as
king of Babylon from 722 BC until he was ousted by Sargon in
710 Bc. The death of Sargon in 706 BC, however, gave him a
second chance and once more he made Babylon an independent
kingdom. It must have been at some point in relation to this
second insurgency that he sent his fateful embassy to Hezekiah
(39:1). The ostensible reason was a gesture to the convalescent
king; the actual reason, in the letter which accompanied the gift,
can be deduced from Hezekiah’s reaction (39:2). Hezekiah may
well have been already compromised by his negotiations with
Egypt, and it was a small (but flattering) thing to be invited to a
further alliance with the prince of freedom fighters! But in his
illness Hezekiah had a specific promise from God: ‘I will deliver
you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria’ (38:6).
From that point on it was surely simply a matter of trusting the
promise and awaiting its fulfilment. To choose instead the way
of alliances, armaments and resources (39:2) was as decisive ney of the way of faith as Isaiah recognized it to be
There is no need to find anything difficult or strange in Isaiah’s prediction of Babylonian captivity. Babylon was plainly a world power; Merodach-Baladan had already once achieved a balance of power in Mesopotamia. The prediction of Babylon — was a sharply relevant message to the king to whom it was addressed: he had chosen Babylon and, like it or not, all his proud possessions would go there! But, of course, Isaiah could not leave it at that. In fact, he must either tear up all his earlier
Zn
INTRODUCTION
prophecies of the glories of the coming king (9:1-7; 11:1-16;
_ 32:1ff.; 33:17) or else he must seek light from the Lord on how,
notwithstanding the end of monarchy and kingdom in captivity,
they would yet be fulfilled. When we remember that, like
Hezekiah, Isaiah lived to experience the astounding faithfulness
of the Lord to his word about shattering Assyria, it is no wonder
that he set alongside his prediction of Babylonian captivity
(39:5-7) his message of comfort that the days of duress would
some day be over (40:1, 2a) and, alongside the king’s great sin in
abandoning faith, his forecast that sin would be exactly and
abundantly dealt with (40:2b). In this way 39:5 — 40:12 can be
compared with 8:21 — 9:7. When the dark day comes, then, for
those with believing minds, there is a bright light beyond the
darkness, a faith to sustain them in the grim realities of life.
(b) Faith waiting
The logic of his work as a prophet thus drove Isaiah to foresee a
future for the Lord’s people beyond Babylon. But, as we have
seen above — and as chapters S6ff. elaborate — the return would
be far from a fulfilment of the people’s longings. They would
come back still a subject people but now without even a
semblance of a king (45:9-13). In fact neither they nor their
circumstances would be vastly changed by the experience of
exile, and chapters 56 — 66 include many evidences of malfunction — political (e.g. 56:9-12), religious (e.g. 57:3-8) and
spiritual (e.g. 59:2-15). What then of the promises? Do the
promises of the king in chapters 1 — 37 and of the Servant in
chapters 38 — 55 still hold good? Yes, says the prophet, and you
must exercise the patience of faith because my salvation is close
at hand, and practise the obedience of faith as you ‘maintain
justice and do what is right’ (56:1).
Isaiah was the prophet of faith, the faith that trusts the
promises, perseveres through the darkness and obediently awaits
the Lord’s time.
i: Hope. The forward view, so prominent in the Isaianic
literature, has two main foci: the city and the Messiah.
The city. Isaiah’s vision (1:1) concerned Judah and Jerusalem,
but to a major extent his preoccupation is the city, with the fate of
the whole kingdom bound up with and settled by what happens in
Jerusalem. Likewise the future is dominated by the prophet’s
expectations of restoration and renewal of the city. It is typical of
the importance of this theme that references to the city, its transformation, international centrality and magnetism for pilgrims
25
ISAIAH
should provide the brackets around the whole literature: 1:21-26;
2:2-4:; 4:2-6 with 65:17-25; 66:7-13; 66:18-24.' Like all
visionaries Isaiah largely furnished the future from the present.
But his development of the ‘city’ theme shows that he was
consciously thinking beyond the geographical Zion/ Jerusalem to
the ideal it embodied. Thus, for example, in 11:6-9 the Lord’s
‘holy mountain’ has become the whole redeemed creation; also in
65:17-18 the easy way the prophet moves from the ‘new earth’ to
the newly created Jerusalem speaks to the same point. In the
Bible the ‘city’ began (Gn. 11:4) as humankind’s attempt to achieve its own salvation without reference to God, and when Isaiah looks forward to the End, he sees the fall of the ‘city’
humankind has built (24:1-10), Babel on a worldwide scale. As
we noted above, the fall of the human city was matched by the stability of the city of salvation (26:1-2). In a word, Isaiah’s
vision is of the Mount Zion to which the redeemed have already
come (Heb. 12:22) and which is also yet to be revealed from
heaven (Rev. 21:2). The Messiah. The three sections of the Isaianic literature are
each dominated by a messianic figure: in the context of inadequate Davidic kings — apostate Ahaz and gullible Hezekiah —
Isaiah depicted the glorious King yet to come (chs. 1 — 37); in the
aftermath of Hezekiah’s great sin of unbelief and the judgment of
exile on a sinful people, Isaiah foresaw the Servant of the Lord,
the sinbearer, effectually the Saviour of the world (chs. 38 — 55);
and finally, envisaging the post-exile people still in subjection,
Isaiah promised the coming Conqueror, exacting vengeance,
bringing salvation (chs. 56 — 66). An initial appreciation of these
three messianic figures can be gained by reviewing the four passages in which Isaiah portrays each figure: 9:1—7; 11:1-16; 32:1—
8; 33:17-24; 42:1-4; 49:1-6; 50:49; 52:13 — 53:12; 59:20-21;
61:1-3; 61:10 — 62:7; 63:1-6. The whole literature is thus a
messianic panorama on a grand scale, as the diagram opposite illustrates.
The point at the base of the diagram is ‘Isaiah’s eye’. All he sees, at first, is darkness with a surrounding brightness — for all
three ‘black patches’ merge into one, as do all three patches of light. He is not looking down on the diagram as we are, but
1 The city under judgment: 1:8; 3:1, 8, 16; 4:3-4; 10:12, 24-25, 32; 22:1-14; 64:10; 66:6. The city preserved: 1:8-9; 26:1; 29:1-8; 31:5-9; 36:15; 37:10, 32— 35; 38:6. The city restored: 40:2, 9; 52:1; 57:13; 61:3; 66:8. Davidic restoration: 1:21, 26-27; 24:23; 33:20. Universal city: 2:24; 11:9; 27:13; 60:14; 62:12; 65:25.

looking along the dotted middle line into the diagram. He identifies the brightness with the Perfect King, who will be the solution where Ahaz failed.

and people to trust the Lord’s promises and walk the way of faith,
preferring rather the way of ‘works’, a rebellious alliance with
Merodach-Baladan. The darkness of Babylonian captivity lay
ahead — but now the brightness is that of a Perfect Servant, who
will succeed where they failed, and in succeeding will make
atonement for their sins. Then, envisaging the people returning from Babylon, Isaiah
sees the darkness of their inability to live for God in a threatening
world and a hostile society. They need a deliverer, and the light
ahead now reveals a coming Conqueror-Deliverer. As is always
the case in the Bible, the truth is cumulative.
ii. God, holiness, sin and salvation. Isaiah is strictly traditional
and orthodox in his theology, moving in a non-innovative way
among the basic principles of Old Testament thought. His innovation resides in his application and outworking of established
and familiar truth. The Holy One of Israel. In Isaiah, as throughout the Old Testament, the basic idea of ‘holiness’ is ‘otherness’ — not ‘otherness’
25
ISAIAH
defined by contrast (other than what?), but ‘otherness’ as
distinctiveness (other because what?). In this sense all the gods
were holy because they possessed their own distinctive nature,
sphere and activity, and those who devoted their lives to the gods
were ‘holy’ as belonging to that distinctive sphere — like the
‘shrine-girl’, literally “holy woman’ (q°désa) of Genesis 38:20.
Isaiah inherited and furthered the Old Testament understanding
that the distinctive of the Lord was his ethical, moral character: to
this he gave definitive statement in the ‘thrice-Holy’ of 6:3 (see Commentary, p. 71), a super-superlative, all-embracing holiness
that made the Lord the uttermost threat to all sinfulness. Indeed, Isaiah is the pre-eminent prophet of divine holiness. He uses, for example, the adjective ‘holy’ (qad65) of the Lord more often than
all the rest of the Old Testament taken together, and focuses it in
a title which he could well have coined, characteristic of the Isaianic literature: The Holy One of Israel. The title is used throughout Isaiah twenty-five times as compared with seven in
the rest of the Old Testament.' Isaiah 6 stands as a microcosm of
the whole book: the Holy One as King (6:1, 5) becomes the theme specially of chapters 56 — 66; the Holy One as the ground
of condemnation of moral condemnation (6:3, 5) is the theme of
chapters 1 — 37; and the revelation of the Holy One as the
ae (6:6—7) finds its fulfilment in the Servant in chapters —55.
The Servant of the Lord. Isaiah likewise breaks no new ground
in his use of the vocabulary of sin and redemption but, once ~
again, it is in vision and application that he becomes distinctive,
referring to the Servant of the Lord in chapters 38 — 55. The
search for an understanding of the Servant has produced a
century and more of controversy.’ There is ground within Isaiah
for thinking of the Servant as the nation, Israel: for example, the
nation is called ‘my servant’ in 41:8 and the Servant is named
‘Israel’ in 49:3. But as soon as details of any such corporate
identification (whether with the nation as a whole or with some
‘remnant’ within the nation) are probed, the theory collapses. In
what sense could either nation or group claim the obedience
evidenced by the Servant in 50:4~-9? Did the nation ever possess the sinlessness required in one who bears another’s sin (53:9; cf,
1 ‘The Holy One of Israel’ occurs twelve times in 1 — 37, eleven times in 38 — 55 and twice in 56 — 66. This should be compared with the seven times elsewhere in the OT: 2 Ki. 19:22; Pss. 71:22; 78:41; 89:18; Je. 50:29; 51:5; Ezk. 39:7. 2H. H. Rowley, The Servant of the Lord (Lutterworth, 1952); C. R. North, The Suffering Servant in Deutero-Isaiah (OUP, 1956).

INTRODUCTION
Ex. 12:5)? In what sense could the nation bring the nation back to
God (49:56)? Likewise, the autobiographical presentation of
49:1—6 and 50:4—9 gives substance to the question in Acts 8:34.
But again the scope and demands of the Servant’s role run
beyond the character and abilities of any known individual of the
past, whether Isaiah or another — not to mention that such an
identification would mean that the Servant came, lived and died
in the past without leaving any record or ripple in history. As the
Commentary shows, if we refuse the fragmentarist approach which began with Duhm and insist in understanding the Songs within an integrated development, the Servant is distinguished in
turn from the errant and spiritually numb nation (42:18—25) and from the spiritually committed and expectant remnant (51:1 — 52:12), leaving a majestic Individual to occupy our gaze (52:13) as he dies bearing the sins of others (53:4~-9) and_ lives to administer the salvation he has wo 53:
portraying the Servant’s death, Isaiah lays under tribute the
established vocabulary of Levitical/Mosaic theology and practice: substitution and peace with God through punishment laid,
by the will of God, on another (53:5-6, 8), a sinless sufferer
(53:9) who provides righteousness for others (53:11) by bearing
their sin (53:12). The towering genius of Isaiah was displayed in
that he saw so clearly that in its truest sense substitution needs a
person to take the place of people. Animal sacrifice can illustrate
the principle, but only one who voluntarily accepts the role (53:7)
and voluntarily pours out himself (53:12) — that is to say,
provides a will to take the place of the sinful will (cf Heb. 10:5—
9) — can achieve by a true substitution the full, indeed final,
salvation of those for whom he dies.
ISAIAH’S BOOK
(a) Recovery of unity
No apology is needed for calling the Isaianic literature ‘Isaiah’s
- book’, for it has never been anything else. There is no manuscript
evidence other than for the literature as it stands: indeed, in the
oldest manuscript available, dating back to 100 BC, the first two
lines of chapter 40 (which is where many scholars say the book
should be divided) come without any break in the text at the
bottom of the column on which chapter 39 ends. Furthermore, the course of present-day study is preponderantly concerned with the unity of this great corpus: ‘Today
scholars are beginning to move from analysis to synthesis [in
order to try to] understand the overall unity and the theological
27
ISAIAH
dynamic of the Isaiah tradition’,' and, within this, few dispute
that Isaiah of Jerusalem was the initiator of the tradition and the
beating heart that kept it alive through (as they would hold) the
centuries that it took to bring it into its present and final shape.
Many are following the lead of B. S. Childs,’ who maintains that
our concern must be with the ‘canonical’ form of Isaiah, not
because of dogmatic views of ‘inspiration’ but on the ground that
this is the form, as P. R. Ackroyd puts it, which is ‘stamped with the hallmark of experiential testing in the life of the community’.* Specialists differ in the extent to which they think it is important
to isolate sections large and small and relate them to the different periods in history in which they are supposed to have originated. Some make this crucially significant,° but others take the literature as it now stands and mine the richness of its inter- relations.°
(b) Models of growth
Within this general approach, some view the Isaianic literature as
growing by addition with three authors strung along a time-line.
Isaiah of Jerusalem (c. 700 BC) was broadly responsible for
chapters 1 — 39; the author of chapters 40 — 55 is ‘Second (or
Deutero-) Isaiah’, who lived in the Babylonian captivity (586—-
539 BC) and worked probably about 540 BC; and the ‘Third (or
Trito-) Isaiah’ ministered to the returned community, 539 BC
onwards.’ Another model is that of accretion: i.e. the growth of
the literature around an original core so that what we have is the
final form of what has been, at all stages, a single ‘book’,
constantly receiving editorial adjustments to meet new situations
along with additions reflecting and extending the spirit of the original (Isaianic) core.®

INTRODUCTION
(c) Arguments and evaluations
This modern search for ways to express the unity of the Isaianic
literature arises from the fragmentation which is the product of
the last one hundred years of specialist study — whether three
‘authors’ working at separated intervals or an anthology collected
by a supposed Isaianic ‘school’. Previously, the assumption of
one single author had provided the ground for considering the
work a unity, but at least since the mid-nineteenth century a
number of factors were taken to make a single author an impossibility.
i. Prophecy. O. T. Allis is correct in rooting the fragmentation
of Isaiah in a nineteenth-century rationalism which denied
predictive prophecy’ — for if prediction is impossible, the
movement of the Isaianic literature progressively into the future
can be explained only by the supposition of new authors working
in those later times. But today, when a modest element of prediction has been readmitted as a possibility, another problem
arises: not whether Isaiah could predict the exile and return, but
would he do so.’ After all, what comfort is it to learn that in
a century’s time all will be well! How could Isaiah’s contemporaries get their minds around the thought of a Babylonian
captivity when their world was dominated by Assyria, not
Babylon, and what would they make of the name of an unknown
king from an as-yet-unknown kingdom? How, come to that,
could Isaiah know, all those years in ahead, the name of Cyrus
(45:1)?
Putting ourselves back, however, into Isaiah’s situation, these
difficulties begin to evaporate. First of all Isaiah says nothing
about a gap of a hundred years between prediction and fulfilment.
It is a caricature to claim he said, ‘Don’t worry! In a hundred
years all will be well!’; he did not say so! G. E. Wright asserts
that ‘a prophecy is earlier than what it predicts but contemporary
with or later than what it presupposes’.’ His intention is to root
prophetic ministry in the prophet’s own situation, to insist that
every message is meaningful to the prophet’s contemporaries.
This suits Isaiah perfectly — and in particular the Babylonian
prophecy of 39:3-6. The name ‘Babylon’ was spoken to Isaiah

ISAIAH
by Hezekiah and thereby became a subject on which the prophet
must comment: indeed, so contemporary and relevant was the
message of captivity that Hezekiah had no right to assume that it
would not happen in his days (39:8)! The advent of MerodachBaladan’s agents reminded him that the balance of power
in Mesopotamia was a fragile thing and that Babylon was,
even then, a candidate for empire.' Besides, how can we who
have seen the sudden disappearance of the Communist empire say that quick change is impossible? Furthermore, as 14:24-27
and 29:1-8 indicate, Isaiah was aware that it would not be Assyria before whom Jerusalem would fall: 39:3-6 was a defining moment in which the dark power behind 6:11—-12 was
named publicly. Regarding Cyrus (who is predicted by name in 44:28), 1
Kings 13:2 (cf. 2 Ki. 23:15—-17) and Acts 9:12 show that nameprediction is not unknown in the Bible. The fact is that, if prediction is admitted at all, we cannot set limits to its exercise.
Nothing of the ‘mechanism’ of revelation, inspiration or prediction is revealed to us, and the Lord of the prophets can
sovereignly declare the exceptional just as much as the usual. In
the case of Cyrus, we can, however, see that the name was
germane to the message of comfort. We only have to picture ourselves as an ethnic minority under a dictatorship to imagine
the sense of foreboding with which the news of an even mightier
dictator would be greeted. In mercy, therefore, would not the
Lord want to assure his people that the greater despot will be
their deliverer? On the one hand, the naming of Cyrus is a
relevant message of comfort to Isaiah’s contemporaries, but, on
the other hand, to refuse to allow that it was Isaiah who named
Cyrus creates two problems: first, it is untrue to 41:25ff. with its
claim that the rise of Cyrus also was a matter of prediction and,
secondly, it negates the force of 45:1—6 that Cyrus would be in a
position to recognize the Lord as the author of all his success. A
later prophet, speaking after Cyrus became news, would be no
better than the priests of Marduk, who were only wise after the
event when they claimed the conqueror’s success in the name of
their god. Only a prophecy with a veritable claim to have anticipated the event could be presented as proof of the sole deity of Yahweh.
ii. Literary style. The difference in the style of chapters 40 — 55 was an early argument for separating them from chapters 1 -
'§. Erlandsson, The Burden of Babylon (CWK Gleerup, 1970).
30
INTRODUCTION
39,' and it is still used? as a means of distinguishing authors, even
though widely discredited.’ It is and always has been a nonsense.
The Lord of the Rings, for example, evidences a narrative style, a
dialogue style and a poetic style. Must it have had three authors?
Could not Milton have written in the jolly rhythms of L’Allegro,
in the sonorous tones of Paradise Lost and also in the measured
prose of Areopagitica? When Isaiah of Jerusalem is presumed to
be the author, a scenario for the two main styles of the book is
simplicity itself. Most of chapters 1 — 35 are a sort of rhythmic
prose, Isaiah’s ‘record of preaching’ style. The messages of the
prophets as they stand could not have been preached: they are too
brief, too quickly come and gone; they do not have the repetitions
and elaborations essential to allow hearers to fix their minds on
what is being said. Like all the prophets, Isaiah filed for the
future carefully crafted encapsulations of his preaching. But the
days of Hezekiah were followed by the ‘police state’ days of
Manasseh (2 Ki. 21:1-18), and maybe in such a time the now
elderly prophet would turn exclusively to writing: this is the real
contrast between the two styles, the one primarily a record of
sermons, the other a solely literary product.
iii. Background. It is plain to see that the envisaged
background to the three sections of Isaiah is different: the earlier
chapters are at home in eighth-century Jerusalem; chapters 40 —
55 envisage a Babylonian exile; and chapters 56 — 66 are once
more in Palestine. On examination, however, a claim that 40 — 55
must have been written in Babylon tends to evaporate. Certainly
they are Babylonian in orientation, but not so in setting. Apart
from the four references to Babylon (43:14; 47:1; 48:14, 20),
there is little that is exclusively or typically Babylonian about the
chapters: ‘When we search for evidence of the prophet’s
residence in Babylon, we are surprised how hard it is to find any
that is convincing.’* Rather, Babylon receives broad-brush

vocabulary, idioms and phrasing of the Isaianic literature and demonstrates
linguistic unity. But see the different results of Reinken’s linguistic researches as
reported by McKenzie (Second Isaiah, p. xvi). Radday (see Dillard and Longman,
Introduction to the Old Testament) used computer technology to demonstrate
diversity. None of these studies has escaped searching criticism.

treatment; it is predicted rather than presupposed. The sort of
detail which betrays an eye-witness is simply not there — what the
city was like, its life, structures, the ‘feel and smell’ of the place
— nor any indication of the organization of the society of the
exiles. In the same way, when these chapters speak of the
experience of being exiled (42:22; 51:14), they bear no relation to
the homesick (Ps. 137:1-6) but generally pleasant (Je. 29; Ezk.
passim) conditions of life (from which, when the time came, so
few were willing to detach themselves, Ezr. 1 — 2!). In his
allusions to the ‘sufferings’ of exile, as, indeed, in his poetic, impressionistic depiction of the fall of Babylon (47:1—-15), the
prophet offers not reportage but poetic use of conventional
stereotypes. Topological background is also important. While the Babylonian scene has not become clear, the Palestinian background
has not grown faint. The idolater goes out into the woods to cut a
tree for carving (46:14), not possible in Babylonia! The trees are
those a Palestinian knows; the oils are those of West Asia (41:19;
55:13); the landscapes and climate are those of the west —
mountains, forests, sea, snow and land refreshed by rain, not by
irrigation.’ The claim that in chapters 40 — 55 we move into a
Mesopotamian milieu is not borne out by the evidence.
iv. Theology. Even as late as 1950, H. H. Rowley could record
that in chapters 40 — 55 ‘the whole tenor of the message ... the ideas that lie behind it ... the thought of God ... are different”
from chapters 1 — 39, but this is simply not the case: expression
and presentation vary-but the theology is the same. First, the
whole is bound together by the title ‘the Holy One of Israel’ (see
above, p. 25-26), and when we consider the enhanced universalism of chapters 40 — 55 it is hard to see why any prophet other
than Isaiah would use a title that so emphasized a particular,
national God. Secondly, the six main theological foci of chapters
1 — 39 continue in 40 — 55: the Lord as Lord of history (10:5—15),
his supremacy over idols (2:12-20), the remnant (8:11—20), God
and sinner reconciled through atonement (6:7), Zion restored
Smart’s research led him to place ‘Second Isaiah’ in Palestine ‘squarely in the aca the international upheavals generated by the exploits of King Cyrus’
“1 See A. Lods, The Prophets of Israel (Kegan Paul, 1937), p. 238. Lods was unable to accept prediction, and therefore made the author of chs. 40 — 55 a West Palestinian working in the post-exile.

INTRODUCTION
(1:26-27) and the Davidic Messiah (9:1—7). Chapters 40 — 48 are
a set of variations on the first three of the above; 53:1—12 is the
‘fulfilment’ of 6:6—7; Jerusalem is as central throughout the rest
of the book as in 1 — 37; and 55:3-4 anchors the revelation of the
Servant in the Davidic covenant.
(d) An ‘Tsaiah’ scenario
Apart from the special exercise of forecasting the name of Cyrus,
there is an easy simplicity in relating everything else to Isaiah of
Jerusalem. The prophet of a glorious future (e.g. 1:26-27; 2:24;
4:4-6; 9:1-7; 11:1-16) is also the prophet of disaster and total
loss (e.g. 5:24-30; 6:11-12; 7:17—-25). Isaiah gathered what we
would call a ‘home-group’ around him (8:16), and these disciples
would have been uncommonly restrained if they did not press the
prophet to say how these strands would intertwine, especially
after he had said to the king that all was consigned to Babylon
(39:6—7). Surely after the events of 39:3—7 Isaiah must either tear
up his earlier promises, or he must now at last answer the
insistent question: how does hope fit in?
Thus circumstances compelled him on — and, since chapters
40 — 55 so admirably fulfil the required role, we must at least
start by assuming that in them Isaiah answered the question. As
we have seen, he builds in no time factors and he says nothing
about Babylon or the exiles that knowledge and common sense
would not suggest. In terms of Wright’s dictum (see p. 29), Isaiah
is speaking wholly within the presuppositions of his time — and,
of course, a prophet’s own earlier predictions are part of the
presuppositional frame within which he ministers.
The basic thrust of his message is going and coming back, the
certainty that doom does not have the last word. But in his
developing vision of the future it is the work of Cyrus, not that of
the Servant, that brings them home to their land. Their
redemption (48:20-21) is political, not spiritual, and thereby
hangs Isaiah’s understanding of the returned community. They
return as the people who went, the ‘wicked’ without peace with
God (48:22). For this reason Isaiah’s portrayal of the returned
community in chapters 56 — 66 is in pre-exilic terms: their sins,
temptations, failings and apostasies are all those of the pre-exile,
likewise the quality of leadership they endure and their political
subjugation. Isaiah’s pre-exilic messages suffice to be the word
of God to his envisaged post-exilic community. Is there anything in all this unavailable to the eye and inspiration of Isaiah of
Jerusalem?

ISAIAH
TEXT
The Hebrew Text (MT) of Isaiah has come to us in fine
preservation without any real doubt what the text means or a
serious necessity of emendation. The Targum of Isaiah (an early
Aramaic paraphrase finalized in the fifth century AD)! witnesses
to a text very close to if not identical with the MT. The Greek
translation of Isaiah, says Ottley,” is ‘by common consent one of the worst translated parts of the LXx’. Ottley, of course, assumed
that the LXx translators were working from the MT as we know it (and it is true that their worst efforts coincide with places where
the Hebrew is unusual in idiom or vocabulary), but it may be that LXxX was in fact following a different Hebrew original’ which we now have no chance of recovering. The Dead Sea Scrolls have
yielded Isaiah material with the manuscript Q* being our oldest
witness to Isaiah. It is at least a thousand years older than the Ben Asher text (MT) of AD 1009. The overwhelming identity between
these two (notwithstanding the time gap) is an astonishing tribute
to careful copying. Such differences as seem to be important are
noted in the Commentary, but ‘our mandate’, says Oswalt, ‘is to interpret the text as it is before us unless there is manuscript evidence to correct that text. To do anything else would be to build our interpretations on air.”*
ISAIAH AND THE NEW TESTAMENT
The New Testament quotes Isaiah more than all the other
prophets together, and does so in such a way as to leave no room
for doubt that the New Testament writers, and the Lord Jesus,
took Isaiah to be the author of the whole book that bears his
name. It is true that in some references ‘Isaiah’ need mean no
more than the book where the quotation is found. Mark 1:2, for
example, seems to use ‘Isaiah’ (as Lk. 24:44 uses ‘the psalms’) to
name that section of the Old Testament Canon of which,
respectively, they are the first books. But when John 12:41 notes
‘Isaiah’ as the one who ‘saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him’, referring to 6:1—10, or when Luke 3:4 quotes from ‘the book of the words of Isaiah’, there can be no doubt that the individual

INTRODUCTION
prophet is intended, and this is, of course, the natural and logical
interpretation of the main bulk of the quotations. The New
Testament quotations cover all sections of the Isaianic literature,
ascribing all alike to the same prophet. The authority of the New
Testament with, at its centre, the authority of Jesus, is decisive.

COMMENTARY
THE BOOK OF THE KING (1 — 37)
I. BACKDROP TO THE MINISTRY OF ISAIAH: THE
AUTHOR’S PREFACE (1 — 5)
s the book of Isaiah has come to us, chapters 1 — 5 forma
Aissive section — like a ‘preface’ to Isaiah’s collected
prophecies. This is apparent for four reasons. (a) The
precise dating of chapter 6 contrasts with the undated oracles in
1:2 — 5:30. Specific events must, of course, have prompted these
oracles, but Isaiah did not find it necessary to state them. (b)
What we call ‘chapter 6’, the prophet’s call, is well suited to form
chapter 1 of the book, following the ‘author’s preface’ (cf. Je.
1:4-19; Ezk. 1:1 — 3:27; although, since the call of Amos is not
noted until Amos 7:10-17, this is not a decisive factor. (c) Apart
from the illustrative reference to the Philistines in 2:6, no foreign
nations are named — not even the threatened super-conqueror of
5:25-30 — and this increases the sense that these chapters offer
general truths designed to form a backdrop to the ‘main’ content
of the book. (d) Chapters 1 — 5 are coherently structured with a
progressive message. The unexpected heading at 2:1 indicates a
fresh beginning, and the matching passages 2:2-4 and 4:2-6 form
a bracket or inclusio (see p. 12) making them a distinct section.
In this way 1:2-31 and 5:1-30 are also marked off as separate
divisions of the prefatory chapters. Thus, the ‘preface’ can be summarized as follows. First is the
heading (1:1). Then 1:2-31 is roundly condemnatory of what the
Lord’s sons have become: rebellious (2), corrupt (4), chastened
(5-6), shattered (7-8), religiously unacceptable (10-15) and
degenerate (21-23). This is not, however, the whole story: for the
Lord has not abandoned (9) and will not abandon (25-28) his
people. Nevertheless, the beginning of the preface is effectively a
declaration that ‘You are not what you ought to have been’.
Isaiah 2:2 — 4:6 opens with a thrilling vision of what Zion was
41
ISAIAH 1:1-31
meant to be: a rallying-point for the whole world, the city of
universal truth and peace. But of course, to the prophet’s eye, it
simply was not so. Far from conforming the world to itself, the
Lord’s people had conformed to the nations (2:6-7) and would,
with the world, come under ultimate divine judgment (2:12-21)
and, nationally, under imminent destabilization (3:1—7). Yet this,
too, is not the whole story, for where Jerusalem’s sin is most in
evidence, in the actions and attitudes of the daughters of Zion
(3:16 — 4:1), the Lord would some day apply cleansing (4:4) and
bring in his new creation (4:5-6). Yet the sad accusation has been substantiated that ‘You are not what you were meant to be’.
Isaiah 5:1-30 can be reviewed as parable (1-7), application
(8-12, 18-23) and consequence (13-17, 24-30), with six ‘woes’
spelling out the bitter fruit (2, 4, 7) produced by the Lord’s
vineyard. Yet the Lord had so spent himself for the good of his
vineyard that there was nothing more he could have done (4).
This is the heart-stopping truth on which Isaiah ends his preface,
the conclusion out of which his prophecy emerges. Note how
chapter 5 begins with song (1) and ends with darkness (30), and
that between those two points, unlike 1:2—31 and 2:2 — 4:6, there
is no message of hope. For if all has already been done, what
more can the Lord do? The theme of chapter 5, therefore, is that
“You are not what you might have been, for a total divine work of
grace was your inheritance and you squandered it’. As far as
chapter 5 is concerned, darkness has the last word. The shutters
have come down on the Lord’s people.
a. Heading (1:1)
On the kings mentioned here, see Introduction, pp. 19-23. Vision
... Saw (Heb. h*z6n ... hazd): these words can refer to ‘visionary
experience’ (29:7; 33:20), but both more usually express the heightened ‘perception’ of truth which the Lord granted by
special revelation to the prophets (e.g. 2 Ch. 32:32; Am. 1:1; Mi.
1:1). The Isaianic literature, then, is ‘the perception of truth
which came to Isaiah by divine revelation’.
b. A comprehensive failure (1:2—31)
In setting the scene for his ministry, Isaiah starts with what must have been obvious — even if the people will not accept his diagnosis, they cannot quarrel with his facts! Nationally (2-9), foreign invasions (7-8) have left a trail of desolation so that the ‘body politic’ (Sc—6) is like the victim of a savage mugging. Religiously (10-20), there has been punctilious devotion — ae in abundance (11), temple attendance (12), monthly and
42
ISAIAH 1:2-4
weekly observances (13-14), prayers (15) — but it has not got
through to God and has done nothing to rectify the national
plight. And socially (21-26), the city life is degenerate and
dangerous (21), its leaders corrupt and self-seeking (23a-d) and
its needy uncared-for (23ef).
Isaiah sets this three-part analysis of the contemporary scene
as if in a court of law. In verse 2ab the witnesses are SIE in
verses 2c—23 the charges are laid and in verses 24~30 sentence is
pronounced. Behind the observable facts Isaiah discerns the
hidden causes: rebellion against the Lord (2d) as the root of
national calamity (5); personal guilt vitiating religious practice
(15); social degeneration through abandonment of revealed
norms of justice and righteousness (21). All this gives colour to a
comparison with Sodom (9-10) and builds a case for divine
punitive action (5, 20, 24, 28, 29-31), but, typically of Isaiah,
there is also a surprise: hope is affirmed. The Lord has not left his
people (9); when he acts it will also be to purge and restore (25—
26), and the very justice and righteousness they abandoned (21)
will be affirmed in a divine work of redemption (27).
i. The national situation (1:2—9). 2a. Isaiah does not explain
why the heavens and earth are summoned to hear. The parallel
address (10) to the accused suggests that ¢reation is called ta
court as the perpetual witness of what happens on earth (Ps.
50:46) and is therefore able to affirm the truth of the divine
accusations. But it may simply be to affirm the dignity of the One
who can convene such a court (cf 1 Ch. 16:31; Ps. 69:34-35) and
the awesomeness of the occasion. 2b. But even greater awesomeness is contained in the reason
given why creation must pay attention: for the LORD himself has
spoken. Here is One whom all creation must obey; it is to him
that his people must render account; and in the unique marvel of
revelation and inspiration the words of the prophet are ‘verbally
inspired’, the very words of the Lord. 3. Israel’s (our) sin is simply unnatural]. Look at the instinctive
actions of the beasts! The locus of our disloyalty is the mind
(know ... understand) just as the mind is the focal point of all
spirituality (cf Ps. 119:33-34, 104, 130; Lk. 24:27, 32; Rom.
1:28; Eph. 4:17-18, 20-22). While know can extend to include
both personal intimacy (Gn. 4:1, NIV ‘lay with’) and lifestyle (1
Sa. 2:12), it retains its base-meaning of knowing the truth.
4. Four nouns of privilege: the unique nation; the redeemed
people; the ‘seed’ or brood (the word used for the line of descent
from Abraham in 41:8); and children (or the Lord’s ‘sons’). Four
43
ISAIAH 1:5-9
descriptions of the lost ideal: sinful, from the participle ‘going on
sinning’, or missing God’s target; loaded with (possibly ‘heavy
with’, hinting that the Lord who carried them felt the burden; cf
46:3-4; Ex. 19:4) guilt, i.e. ‘iniquity’ (‘dwon), meaning sin as
corruption of character and nature; of evildoers, i.e. the chosen
seed has become those who commit evil; and, lastly, given to
corruption, ‘acting corruptly’, from Heb. sahat, to spoil, ruin.
They have forsaken ... spurned ... turned their backs: here is the
basic principle of spiritual decline, a sustained rejection of the
Lord. Maybe we should translate ‘turned themselves back into aliens’, i.e. reverting to what they were prior to their redemption.
On the Holy One of Israel see Introduction, pp. 25-26. The
height of their privilege, to know the Lord in the fullness of his holy nature, became the benchmark of the depth of their fall.
5-8. What is important in these verses is not which historical
invasion they reflect. The choice probably lies between the
Aram-Ephraim incursion, c. 735 BC (2 Ki. 15:37 — 16:6; 2 Ch. 28;
see Introduction, p. 20; cf: on 7:1—2) or the Assyrian attack in 701
BC (chs. 36 — 37; 2 Ch. 32; see Introduction, p. 21). The
important thing is Isaiah’s view of history as the arena of divine
moral judgment. The enemy depredations (7-8) which have left
the nation crippled (S—6) from top (head) to toe (foot), inwardly
(heart) and outwardly (head ... foot), and without remedy (not
cleansed ... bandaged), were a divine chastisement, with more to
come if they persist in rebellion. None of Isaiah’s kings (1:1) was
inept. They managed a sound economy and followed clever
policies, yet the land was devastated (5c-7), fragile internally
(8bc) and threatened externally (8d). The key to national wellbeing is righteousness, i.e. what is right with God (Pr. 14:34), and in this the prophet records dismal failure.
9. But for the Lord’s people there is another factor, the
surprising element of hope. Merit says one thing; mercy says
another. As far as desert is concerned the Lord must either
apologize to Sodom or visit judgment on Israel! But he is the
Lord Almighty, literally ‘the LORD of [who is] hosts’ — where the
plural indicates that in himself he is and has every potentiality
and power. Consequently he is sovereign to act in whatever way accords with his nature. The same Lord (2) who judges also acts in forbearing preservation (9). Because of the Lord’s love, we are not terminated, for his compassions do not fail (La. 3:22). Thus Isaiah rounds off the section.
ii. The religious situation (1:10—20). Isaiah turns now to the religious life of the nation. The placing of this topic between his
44
ISAIAH 1:10-20
review of national fortunes (2-9) and social conditions (21-23) is significant. The kemel of every national problem is how people relate to God. They cannot be right anywhere if they are wrong here. Religion determines everything.
But the people were extremely religious: they expended time
on monthly, weekly and other observances (13); the financial cost
of sacrifices and offerings (11) was considerable. It would be
strange if they did not ask why, since they did so much for him,
the Lord seemed to be doing nothing for them. But that is just the
point: their religion was ‘what we do for God’ and not ‘how we enter into the grace he offers to us’.
These verses have been the centre of a difference of opinion.
Some note how in verse 11 the Lord denies the significance of
sacrifices, in verse 12 their divine authorization, and in verse 13
issues commands to end them. On this view, Isaiah is calling for
‘morality without religion’, an ethically focused walk with God
devoid of ritual observance.’ But it can be questioned whether
this understanding is true to Isaiah. Is it likely that he was so
revolutionary as to repudiate the tradition in which he had been
nurtured and which he would have traced back to Moses? Such a
conclusion would require more than the ‘say so’ of a brief
passage like this! Furthermore, if the passage repudiates temple
rites, then it repudiates equally the Sabbath (13) and prayer (15)!
Rather, Isaiah invite i i stem
redeeming grace (Ex. 6:6-7; 12:13), the gift of the law (Ex. 20)
and the fo igi Ex. 25 — Lv. 27) followed
one another in that order as parts of a single whole. The law was
given so that those who had already been redeemed by the blood
of the lamb would know how their Redeemer (Ex. 20:2) wished
them to live. The sacrifices were provided to cover lapses in
obedience (cf 1 Jn. 1:7). But as [sai aro aw
eople long on religion an n_morality. They were as
morally negligent as Sodom (10), their offerings were
meaningless (13; lit. ‘a gift of nothing’) because the Lord cannot
bear wickedness coupled with religious punctiliousness. The
hands they raised in prayer were blood-stained from wrongdoing
(15). Like all the prophets Isaiah operated squarely within the
Mosaic revelation, and his charge in this passage is that his
contemporaries had put asunder what the Lord, through Moses,
1 This same interpretation is offered by some for Je. 7:21-22; Ho. 6:6; Am. 5:24-25; Mi. 6:6-8. See the excellent overview in H. H. Rowley, The Unity of the
Bible (Carey Kingsgate, 1953), pp. 38ff., and J. A. Motyer, ‘Prophecy, Prophets’,
in NBD.

)
ISAIAH 1:10-20
had joined together, namely, the means of grace (the sacrifices)
and the obedient life which they were intended to sustain. The act
— the ritual, divorced from its source in a heart grate 1 for
rede m ction 1 ent_ life — was
meaningless and abhorrent to the Lord (13).
10. Like all the prophets Isaiah held that he was the
mouthpiece of the Lord, the channel of the divine word. Law
means ‘teaching’, the imparting of truth, within which, of course, there is a place for authoritative direction, command and prohibition. But the Lord’s /aw first of all is the loving instruction
that a caring father gives a loved child (cf Pr. 4:1—-2). Apart from
mercy they would have been judged like Sodom and Gomorrah
(9), but it surely is mercy, for they are like Sodom and Gomorrah
in fact. 11. The standing error of the ritualist is that if all depends on
performing the ceremonial act, then the more you do it the better.
Says is a continuous tense: ‘keeps saying’ — as something he
presses home upon us. Apart from Psalm 12:6 only Isaiah (1:18;
33:10; 40:1, 25; 41:21; 66:9) uses this verbal form referring to
divine speech. To the Lord the ritual act means nothing (11ab),
adds nothing (11cd) and does nothing (1lef). No pleasure: 53:10
uses the same verb (‘it was the LORD’s will’) of a mighty
sacrifice which delighted him.
12. Appear before me (or ‘meet with me’) may also be
translated ‘see my face’, depending what vowels we supply to the
consonants of the Hebrew text. The two ideas taken together
express the reality and wonder of true worship (cf, e.g., Ex.
23:15, 17). Trampling: a religion of ritual is only the noise of feet
on a pavement.
13-15. The denunciation continues. Become a burden (14):
i.e. the rituals are not themselves a burden, for the Lord
commanded them to start with. It i the us buse of
divin inances that vexes him. This is true even of prayer
(15), for we can ‘pray on Sunday and prey on our neighbours for
the rest of the week’. Hide my eyes: the opposite of the shining
face of approval and blessing (Nu. 6:25; Ps. 4:6). What makes prayer unavailing i epented ongdoing (hands ... full of blood). Not only the Lord’s eyes but his ears too are alienated from such praying: literally ‘I am not even listening’. 16-20. But there is a way back and through to God: actions they can take (16-17, nine commands), a promise they can ex- perience (18), a blessing they can find (19) or lose (20). In verses 16-17 the nine commands fall into three groups of three. First, ‘make yourselves clean before God by the cleansing ordinances
46
ISAIAH 1:21-31
he has provided’ and this will take your evil deeds (lit. ‘the evil of
your deeds’) out of my sight. The cleansing offered is effective
before God. Now follow three commands to reorder personal life;
stop, a decisive abandonment of sin; Jearn, the cultivation of a
new mind; and seek, set different objectives. Justice (mispat from
\sapat), ‘to determine authoritatively / judicially what is right’, is
often used, as here, to express the sum total of what the Lord
judges right, the will of God for his people’s conduct (cf. 42:1, 3—
4). The third triad_of commands calls for the reformation of
society: encourage the oppressed translates an altered Hebrew
text:' literally ‘reform/set straight the oppressor’. Society must
be transformed both at the point of the one inflicting — the
oppressor — and at the point of the one suffering hurt — the
fatherless ... the widow.
In verse 16 the Lord called his people to resort to his cleansing
ordinances. In verse 18 he pledges their effectiveness. Scarlet is
the colour of guiltiness (cf 15). Reason (Heb. Vyakah, sometimes
used of arguing a case in court, e.g. 2:4): the Lord calls his people
to the b is justice wh onl
guilty. But it is there that they hear words of free pardon based on
the substitutionary death of a divinely appointed sacrifice. The
Lord’s pardon, like all his actions, accords perfectly with his
justice. See below on 49:24~26. Snow ... wool: both naturally
white, not made so by bleaching. The promise, therefore, is of a holy nature, not j eansi Le
Obedience is a serious matter (19-20). It is a ‘means of grace’
bringing the best. They must ‘obey willingly’ (be willing and
obedient), not just offer conformism. The commands of verses
16-18 are backed by serious divine sanctions: obedience is the
key virtue of God’s people and disobedience their worst calamity.
Sword: the forces at work in history are at the Lord’s command in
the interest of his just punishments, see on 10:5-15. For the
mouth ...: a very emphatic attribution of Isaiah’s words to the
Lord himself.
iii. The social situation and its consequences (1:21-31).
From the literary point of view these verses contain three
INIV (oppressed) alters the MT from hamds (‘oppressor’) to hamiis
(‘oppressed’). The change is as unnecessary as it is minimal. ‘Put right the
oppressor’ (lit.) deals with the cause of social breakdown, the wrongdoer, not just
the consequence (the person hurt). This is what Isaiah sought. 2 To treat v. 18 as a question (‘Since your sins are ... can they be ...?”) casts
doubt on the promissory nature of the passage. Verse 18 is as realistic as a
promise as v. 16 is as a command.
47
ISAIAH 1:21-24
components. (a) Verses 21-26 comprise a self-contained poem
with the thought of the faithful city as a bracket, or inclusio. The
opening word how (’ékd, cf. La. 1:1), and the prevailing ‘metre’,
make it formally a lament. The poem sets out the social situation
confronting Isaiah (21-23) and the divine reaction in judgment
(24) and restoration (25-26). (b) Verses 27-28 note the
alternatives: penitence or perishing. Finally, (c) verses 29-31
enlarge (29, 30) on the thought of the penitent people (27), with
their deep shame for the past and its blighting consequences, and
(31) on the judgment (28) on the impenitent: the self-sufficient are the cause of their own destruction. Thus three originally
distinct pieces of literature are brought together into a new formation: verses 21-23 continue the explorations begun in
verses 2-9 and 10-20 by sketching the state of society; verses 24-26 open the future as the arena of judgment and hope; and verses 27-28 and 29-31 refiect on this twofold prospect. 21. Faithful city ... harlot: only here and in 23:15—18 does
Isaiah use the metaphor of sexual infidelity. Everything else
followed in a downward spiral from this basic failure to live as a
faithful wife with the Lord. Isaiah notes, first, the breakdown of
moral ideals: justice and righteousness. Rooted in the divine
holiness (5:16), righteousness embodies holiness in sound
principles and justice expresses righteousness in sound precepts.
Secondly, he observes the breakdown of moral relationships:
murderers. When commitment to the Lord goes, breaching the
‘first table’ of the law (harlotry), the breach of the ‘second table’ ©
follows (murder). Social values cannot be created and maintained
without spiritual commitment.
22-23. Illustration (22) leads into reality (23). Silver which
has become dross is totally degenerate; once wine is touched by
water, no particle remains undiluted. Thus sin degrades the
nature it enters and leaves no part untainted. The rulers provide a
window into society: Godward they are rebels (cf. 2) and break
his law by consorting with thieves; they abuse their position for ope leh in bribes and gifts; and have no concern for other people.
24. So much for the rulers (23), but what does the real Sovereign think — he who is Lord ... Almighty ... Mighty One? He is the Lord (Heb. ha’ad6n), omnipotent in power, the LORD Almighty (cf. 9), and absolute ruler of his people, the Mighty One of Israel (“bir yisra’él, as in 49:26; 60:16; cf Gn. 49:24; Ps. 132:2, 5). Terrifyingly, this vast power is directed to a just vengeance. The sin of his people hurts the Lord, the divine nature is offended and he must get relief. The platitude that ‘God hates
48
ISAIAH 1:25-29
the sin but loves the sinner’ needs to be countered by the
description of those who have hurt him as my foes ... my enemies.
Sin sets God at variance with the sinner. But sin also invites
divine retribution. The verb avenge (ndqgam) makes its only
appearance in Isaiah here, but cf: the noun (e.g. 35:4; 47:3; 61:2).
25 continues the thought of personal divine action against
sinners, for the hand is the symbol of personal agency, e.g. verse
15; 10:13. To turn (‘bring back’) the hand is always a picture of
hostile action (e.g. Ps. 81:14), but here, surprisingly, it leads into
a work of purging (25bc) and restoration (26). The punitive and
the restorative acts of God are bound into one. Truly, in wrath he
remembers mercy (Hab. 3:2). Isaiah’s message of hope is thus
essential to the way he thinks: (a) a poem (21-26, see above)
about sin and vengeance (21—25a) imperceptibly makes the
transition into a poem about purging and restoration (25b—26);
and (b) a menacing act (to turn the hand) becomes a work of
mercy. Purge: ‘refine as with detergent’, as if to say, ‘You have
your means of cleansing and so have I’. Dross: as in verse 22.
The Lord will deal with the degenerate nature as well as with the
impurities of life.
26. It was David who in days of old ... at the beginning made
Jerusalem the capital of the united kingdom (2 Sa. 5:6—-9), and
Isaiah now looks forward to David’s return and the fulfilment of
the promises (cf 2 Sa. 7; Ps. 89). In this quiet way he introduces
a theme which will become increasingly dominant in his book.
Righteousness ... Faithful: ‘right with God’ in the principles and
practice of holiness, Faithful to him as a true wife, see verse 21.
27. But how will the Lord purge (25) and restore (26)? He will
do so (a) objectively, by the divine work of redemption: redeemed (pada), ‘to pay a ransom price’ (cf. Ex. 13:13; Lv. 27:27);
and (b) subjectively, by the human act of repentance (her penitent
ones). Thus Isaiah can insist that the Lord’s mercies are moral
mercies achieved in accordance with justice and righteousness,
for they rest upon a price paid to meet the demands of his law
and upon the moral factor of penitence and a return to God.
28. Those, however, who refuse the way of penitence remain
under the claims of justice and perish. The Hebrew is terse: ‘But
shattering for those continuing to rebel and for the sinful — all at
once!’ Those who perish do so because of their unruly will
(rebels), their falling short of the ideal (sinners) and their
rejection (forsake) of the Lord. Er iy eer
29. The Hebrew opens this verse with ‘For’, justifying the
charge of forsaking the Lord (28). Outwardly they observed the
worship of the Lord (10-15), but their hearts (delighted) and
49
ISAIAH 1:30-31
wills (chosen) followed the nature and fertility cults of the day
(oaks ... gardens), cf, 27:9; 57:3-6; 66:17. Isaiah did not believe
that one religion was as good as another! True religion shows
itself in moral commitment (10-20), has a surer basis (i.e.
revelation) than mere human preference (29; of Am. 4:5) and
plugs into a source of life not subject to earth’s withering (30).
30. Evergreens were suitable symbols of undying life and
became the focus of nature religion and the fertility of land,
animals and humans, so important in an agricultural society. The
equivalent today is a sound economy and a growing gross national product. These have ever been the chosen gods of the
natural man. But earthbound religion is subject to earth’s fading
and earth’s uncertain resources (without water). ;
31. Mighty: people who fancy themselves strong through their
chosen gods; work: the idol gods they fashion and the gardens
they have planted as the focus of their religion. Self-sufficiency
and man-made gods are a dangerous combination like tinder and
a spark!
c. The ideal, lost and found (2:1 — 4:6)
In the second ‘movement’ of his preface (see pp. 41-42 above),
Isaiah’s review of the contemporary scene (2:5 — 4:1) covers
much of the ground surveyed in 1:2-31. Isaiah 2:5-21 concentrates on the religious situation and the failure of the false
gods; 3:1 — 4:1 reviews the collapse of ordered society because of
underlying moral failure. The bracket or inclusio around this is -
formed by two beautiful poems, beginning with what Zion was
meant to be (2:2—-4) and ending with what Zion will yet be (4:2-
6). Chapters 2 — 4 match chapter 1 not only in content but also in
underlying philosophy. The work of man is always unto
destruction, with an apparent inevitability: objectives like making
money (2:7ab), or security through armaments (2:7cd), contribute
as much to the coming day of judgment as do making and
worshipping false gods (2:8); humankind’s best endeavours to
construct a secure society come under divine ‘deconstruction’
(3:1—7) because of the unrecognized seriousness of sins of speech (3:8), and what might be thought of as the harmless luxury of a well-furnished wardrobe (3:16-23) in fact reflects frivolous and worldly vain-gloriousness. But the Lord is never nonplussed. Zion comes under inescapable wrath but Zion will be redeemed. The Lord will yet realize the ideal which his people corrupted.
i. Heading (2:1). The easiest explanation of this unexpected ‘heading’ is that what we call chapters 2 — 4 once ‘circulated’ as a
50
ISAIAH 2:2-3
separate ‘book’ or even as a ‘wall-newspaper’ (see on 8:1; 30:6). Saw: see on 1:1.
_ li. The great ‘might have been’ (2:2-4). The use of this poem
in Micah 4:14 raises the question which prophet ‘copied’ from
the other or whether both quoted an existing hymn. The passage
is equally ‘at home’ in each context, but possibly the variations in
wording suggest that Micah’s version-is a free quotation. The
poetic quality is worthy of Isaiah’ and the topic more suited to
him than to any other, with his enthusiastic love of Zion and its
traditions. The poem is rooted in the universalism of the
Abrahamic promise (Gn. 12:2—3; 22:16-18) but in its present
context Isaiah makes it a challenge to his contemporaries: if the
world is ever to say Come, let us go up (3), the Lord’s people
must heed the call Come ... let us walk (5): the first requirement
in evangelism is to have a church that is worth joining!
2. The (lit.) ‘end/culmination of the days’ is neither
necessarily distant nor certainly near, but always imminent. It
expresses the certainty of what God will do and the urgency of
present readiness. Mythologically, mountains were the homes of
the gods; historically, the Lord chose Mount Zion (Pss. 78:68;
87:1—2); eschatologically, the whole earth will be the Lord’s
mountain home (11:9). This is why Isaiah speaks here of the
Lord’s ‘house’ (not temple). A ‘temple’ is primarily a place for
worship; a ‘house’ is primarily where the Lord has come to live
among his people (cf Ex. 29:42-46). Raised ... stream: the
supreme exaltation of his mountain home expresses the Lord’s
triumph over all the so-called gods on their mountains. See Psalm
48:2, where Zaphon is the mountain of Baal (cf Ps. 95:3-4). The
natural impossibility of a stream flowing upwards is intentional.
A supernatural magnetism is at work.
3. The result is universal recognition. Though drawn supernaturally (2), they come voluntarily. Their unanimity (Come, let
us) in seeking the LORD nullifies nationalism. Something makes
them willing to seek the God of Jacob, namely a hunger for
revealed truth. They come to learn (he will teach), to obey (we
may walk), to receive what cannot be had elsewhere (lit. “because
the law/teaching will go out’), and this ‘teaching’ is nothing less
than the actual word of the LORD. Teach ... walk: this is real
1 J. Gray holds that both prophets quote from a current liturgy (‘The Kingship
of God’, Vetus Testamentum 11 [1961], p. 15); G. Von Rad argues that ‘it cannot
be doubted that the text is Isaianic’ (‘The City on the Hill’, in The Problem of the
Hexateuch [Oliver and Boyd, 1966], pp. 232ff.).

ISAIAH 1:4-6
knowledge, a grasp of truth issuing in a changed life, the head
arneie ieatend redirecting the feet (Lk. 24:32-33). Law:
see on 1:10. ie
4. The world will be transformed. Submission to the Lord
brings the world under his rule whereby he will judge (‘decide
issues’) and settle disputes (‘arbitrate’). Where the Lord thus
reigns, nationalisms are gone and weapons of war are made into
garden tools: Eden has returned. The means of war (swords ...
spears), the practice of war (take up) and the mentality of war
(train for) are gone.
iii. The actual Jerusalem — part one (2:5—-21). By contrast
with this exciting ideal (2-4) Isaiah now faces the harrowing
actual! The exhortation (5) itself implies that the Lord’s people
are not walking in his light, and verses 6-21 justify the
implication in two poems: the first (6-9) asserting that blessing is
impossible. The brackets/inclusio you have abandoned (6) ... do
not forgive (9) speak of the alienation of the Lord and of his
mercies because of three offences: conformity to the world (6),
seeking worldly resources and securities (7) and worshipping
man-made gods (8). The second poem (10-21) asserts that
judgment is inevitable. Closely related to verses 6-9 by the
themes of human self-sufficiency (11, 17; cf 6~7) and idolatry
(20; cf. 8), this intricate poem shows how the Lord has only to
reveal his glory (10) and human arrogance falls (11), the world as
it reflects human pride is flattened (12-17), idols are exposed as
useless (18-19) and people defenceless (20-21). There is no
exceptional exercise of divine power: only the Lord displaying what he always is!
5 offers The first exhortation: walk with the Lord (matched
by a second exhortation in 2:22). Jn the light means in the light of
the Lord’s favour (Nu. 6:25), his presence and care (Ps. 27), his
truth (Ps. 43:3) and his revealed word (Ps. 119:105).
The following section (6-21) can be entitled The first exposure: the pride that makes its own gods (matched likewise
by a ‘second exposure’ in 3:1 — 4:1).
6. The initial ‘For’ (omitted in NIV) introduces an explanation
of the surprising need (5) to recall the Lord’s people to the Lord, but it springs from a dire cause. He has abandoned them, because, first, ‘they are full from the East’ (lit.). In contrast to the ‘light of the Lorp’ (5), they look eastward to the sun rising, for all the light they need. Secondly, ‘they are fortune-tellers like the Philistines’. They guide their lives by human ingenuity. The Philistines, not especially known in the Bible for divination, are
32
ISAIAH 2:7-11
selected as typical of the uncircumcised Gentiles (Jdg. 14:3),
those untouched by special grace and revelation, the dregs (so to
speak) of the world. Thirdly, they clasp hands with pagans: most
likely ‘make agreements with’, i.e. alliances for trade or security;
or, maybe, ‘engage in worship with’ (cf Ps. 47:1, using a
different verb); or ‘abound in’ (verb found in Jb. 36:18) what
pagans have on offer. In turn, then, they were earthbound in their
expectations (‘full from’), their models (like the Philistines) and their associations (with pagans).
7-8. The worldliness of verse 6 is applied in three directions:
values (silver ... gold), security (horses ... chariots) and religion
(idols). In each category the adjective ‘earthbound’ describes
their philosophy of life. Jdols (’ ‘lilim): literally ‘nonentities’. The
word is a pun on ’“/ohim, ‘God’. They may seem to be the real
thing but they are not!
9. Do not forgive. The Hebrew imperative not only commands
but also can be used to express an inevitable outcome, here ‘the
conviction that something cannot or should not happen’,’ i.e. ‘and
there is no way you can forgive them’.
In verses 10-21, the two main sections of this poem fall into
four sub-sections. The first two (10-11, 12-17) share the theme
of arrogance humbled. Note the matching endings of verses 11
and 17. The second two, each concluding with shake the earth
(18-19, 20-21) share the theme of powerlessness exposed:
people flee in terror (19) and throw away their useless idols (20).
How does all this come about? Simply that the LorD will be
exalted (11) and he rises (21). The Lord does not need to exert
his power; he merely reveals his presence!
10—11. Ground: earthbound in the wisdoms they cherished (6),
the values and securities they sought (7) and the gods they
worshipped (8), now in their extremity they have only the earth
to turn to. The terms of verses 10-11 stand in sharp contrast:
splendour ... majesty as opposed to humbled ... low. It is the
simple unveiling of the majesty of the Lord which brings
humankind to the dust. Splendour is glory visibly displayed;
majesty, from a verb ‘to be high’, is ‘exaltedness’, superiority of
status and being. The eyes: the eye represents the direction in
which one is looking and therefore stands for the aims and
interests of life. Hence it is the organ of desire (Ps. 123:2), the
expression of humility (Ps. 131:1) or, here, of arrogance.

Wales Press, 1949), pp. 49-50.
53
ISAIAH 2:12-21
12-17. A day: i.e. the day of the Lord. To the Hebrew mind,
time was a moving line with the future moving into the present
and away into the past. Every day was individually placed on this
conveyor belt by divine faithfulness (Gn. 8:22; Ps. 74:16; Je.
33:20, 25), and sooner or later the Lord would include the day
which he has in store (12). In verses 12-16 for means ‘against’.
Cedars ... oaks ... mountains ... hills (13-14): as God’s world,
creation is always on his side (cf. 1:2); but, as our world, it is
infected by our sinfulness and God’s curse on sin (Gn. 3:17). The
thorns of Genesis 3:18 are at one and the same time creation’s
reflection of divine hostility to sin and evidence of creation’s
corruption by sin (cf Rom. 8:20-23). Tower and wall (15)
represent both human achievement and human attempts to achieve community and security (Gn. 11:1—-9). Trading ship (16):
literally ‘ships of Tarshish’, the largest known ships, capable of
the greatest voyages. Such ships demonstrated human triumph over environmental forces and human enterprise creating commercial empires (Ezk. 28:2-5). Vessel (16): a word found only
here (s° kiyy6t) and of uncertain meaning. If it is related to maskit (‘figure, visual representation’; Nu. 33:52) possibly it means
‘figurines’, human artistic achievement as another dimension in
which pride can raise its head (RSV, ‘craft’).
Arrogance ... pride (17): both words come from verbs
expressing ‘height’ and are ways in which we can think of
ourselves ‘more highly’ than we ought to think (Rom. 12:3), the
opposite of the humble mind (Eph. 4:2).
18-19. The day of the Lord, when it comes, will be a worldwide event leaving the whole earth ‘shaken’. The word Isaiah
uses means more strictly ‘to terrify’ (“ros), expressing dread
before superior power (e.g. 29:23). The adjective (’aris) is used
of despotic, irresistible power (13:11; 23:3-5). The Lord will
reveal himself, then, in daunting, immobilizing power with a
double result: in the spiritual realm, the end of the ‘no-gods’ (18;
‘lilim, see on verse 8); in the human realm, the exposure of the helplessness of humankind (19). Once more those who made human resources their security (6-8, 10) will find that now they have nowhere else to turn. 20-21. Verse 18 recorded the end of the ‘no-gods’ before the splendour of the exalted Lord. Now, however, their uselessness is recognized by their erstwhile adherents. The day of the Lord is the ultimate test. Nothing will avail when the LORD ... rises.
iv. The actual Jerusalem — part two (2:22 — 4:1). Just as 2:5 formed a bridge between the ideal Zion of 2:24 and Isaiah’s first
54
ISAIAH 3:1
exposure of the actual state of the city (2:6-21), so another
exhortation (2:22) acts as a bridge to his second exposure (3:1 —
4:1), in which he concentrates on the collapse of Jerusalemite
society. We saw in chapter 1 how central is a people’s relationship with the Lord. Once again the point is made: he began
his delineation of Zion’s fall from its ideal by focusing on man
the god-maker (2:8, 18, 20). Now he proceeds to show that
because of this basic reality of pride — the replacement of the true
God by the false gods — society must inevitably collapse. Has not
the time come, then, to prepare for the day of the Lord by
renouncing all merely human reliance? Isaiah 3:1 — 4:1 (note that
3:1 should begin with the explanatory word ‘For’) adds a further
reason to cease relying on human strength. The section falls into
two parts. The first (3:1-15) is marked off by the inclusio the
Lord, the LORD Almighty (1, 15) and deals with Jerusalem’s
leaders under divine judgment (1-7, 12-15). Between these two
passages, verses 8-11 explain the deep cause of Jerusalem’s
collapse (8) and the judgment that will fall (9-11). In 3:16 — 4:1
Isaiah turns from the leading men of the city to its leading
women, and finds incarnate in them the spirit of arrogant selfsatisfaction which is the death warrant of the city itself.
The second exhortation: renounce human reliance (2:22).
Human reliance has been the story-line of Isaiah’s first exposure.
It has no currency in the day when the Lord in person must be
faced. Breath: a reminder that human life is not independent or
self-sustaining, but given (42:5; Gn. 2:7), and not a secure thing
to rely on. Of what account: this does not question the value of
humankind. It explains the foregoing: humankind has no value as
a basis for security. The gift of breath implies a Giver and points
to the wisdom of trusting.
The second exposure: social collapse and its cause (3:1 —
4:1). The great ideal (2:2-4) has suffered a second set-back:
Jerusalemite society is collapsing. Far from moving towards
becoming the strong focus of a stable and peaceful world, it is
itself falling apart and under divine judgment. 3:1-7 makes
evident the disintegration: everything that makes for a content
and stable society will soon be removed by divine action;
3:8-15 speaks of the root cause and its consequences; 3:16 — 4:1
is a separate oracle focusing on the women of Zion, which
balances the accusation and judgment of the leading men in
3:2-4, 1. When rulers fall or rise it is the Lord, the LORD Almighty
who removes and appoints (4). (On his titles, see 1:9.) Supply ...
support are the masculine and feminine forms of the same word,
a)
ISAIAH 3:2-11
a Hebrew idiom for ‘every support of every kind’. Cf verse 7 for
the ‘other end’ of this inclusio. ne
2-3 contains a sweeping survey of supposed social stabilizers
who will be removed. All these will go: leaders in law and order
(2a); national figures (2b); people of influence (2c-3), both
illegitimate (soothsayer, i.e. fortune-teller; clever enchanter, lit.
those ‘instructed in whispering’, ie. in whispering to the dead,
‘spiritists’; cf 8:19; Dt. 18:9-13), and legitimate (counsellor;
elder, i.e. local government officer, cf Ex. 3:16; Dt. 19:12;
captain or ‘prince’, i.e. civil servant); and supporting agencies
(skilled craftsmen).
4. Boys (those without experience or maturity, as Je. 1:6) and
children (ta‘‘lilim, only elsewhere at 66:4, possibly ‘capriciousness’ or ‘ruthlessness’): leaders behaving with the
unpredictability and thoughtless cruelty of children.
5. At the grassroots there will be a developing ‘rat race’ of
divisive and ruthless self-seeking (Sab), an intolerant age gap
(5c) and advancement without regard to worth (5d).
6—7. Leadership is no longer treated seriously, and the most
frivolous qualifications are taken as adequate (6), but, coupled
with this, there is a loss of public spirit whereby people are
unwilling to take responsibility (7).
8—-9c are an explanation, though NIV omits the explanatory
conjunction ‘For’ in each of its two occurrences. Why is there all
this evidence of disintegration? ‘Because Jerusalem has stumbled
... fallen’. And why has this happened? ‘Because their tongue
and their deeds are against the LORD’. Thus we are led to the root
cause of social breakdown. It is both spiritual (against the LORD),
evidenced verbally (their words), and practical (their ... deeds).
Jerusalem’s guilt is compounded by the fact that it is not regarded
by the people as their guilty secret and they have no sense of
guilt. Sin is no longer sin, it is the new morality. Thus it is that societies collapse.
9d-11. In a form typical of Wisdom writers (cf 28:23-29;
32:38) Isaiah affirms the principle of due and just reward both
for the righteous (10) and the wicked (11). The righteous are not promised immunity to earth’s troubles. Doubtless many of them would be named in the casualty lists of 3:25 - 4:1 but nevertheless it will be well.
In verses 12-15, the self-contained poem of 9d—11, expressing the principle of exact retribution, is followed by this vignette of a courtroom. Together the passages are an excellent example of how Isaiah brings together into a new ‘mosaic’ pieces of his ministry that were originally separate or belonged in other
56
ISAIAH 3:12-15
contexts. My people (12, 15) forms an inclusio within which
verse 12 is the situation to be remedied at law, in verses 13-14b
the Judge takes his seat, and in verses 14c-15 himself brings the charge against the accused.
12 consists of an outraged exclamation, My people! followed
by an address, O my people, as outrage becomes concern and we
sense the Lord’s heart of compassion for his mistreated ones.
Youths oppress: the verb oppress is a plural participle, ‘his
oppressors/slave drivers’, as in Exodus 3:7. Is this a ‘plural of
greatness’, ‘their chief slaver’ — a reference to, say, King Ahaz
(1:1)? Youths is a singular noun of uncertain meaning, possibly
related to a verb ‘to nurse’ (V‘i/) and to a noun (‘o/é/), ‘an
infant’, with overtones here of irresponsibility and wantonness.
Possibly, therefore, “Your big slave-driver is an irresponsible
wanton/a spoiled brat.’ Women could then be a reference to such
a king’s harem as being the powers behind the throne, but
possibly, like Amos 4:1, Isaiah is commenting more widely on
the influence of demanding women throughout Jerusalemite
society (cf 16-21). Your guides: ironically Isaiah uses a word
meaning ‘those who set you right’, which is the true task of a
leader; but here ‘those who set you right set you wrong!’ They
turn you from the path: literally ‘and the road of your paths they
swallow up’, ‘road’ here being the ‘direction’ that a ‘path’ is
taking. The old established signposts of right living and sound
society are gone as totally as if someone had swallowed them!
13-14. But however passionately the Lord feels (12) he does
not rush to act. Everything must be done with legality and justice
(Gn. 18:25). Vineyard (14) is symbolic of the Lord’s care in
choosing, delivering and settling his people and his delight in his
people. But these leaders not only stripped the vineyard, they
plundered it. 15. Crushing (daka’) is always metaphorical and always used
of the severest maltreatment (53:5, 10). Grinding (Vtahan): as in
a mill (Nu. 11:8). They were not only cruel (crushing) but they
treated those they ruled as a crop to be reaped for selfenrichment. The section 3:16 — 4:1 is the expected sequel to the court
scene of verses 13-15: the pronouncing of the sentence. Isaiah
supplies it by introducing a separate oracle focusing on the
women (lit. ‘daughters’) of Zion. In this way he (a) makes his
accusation include all alike: the leading men in 3:2-4 are
matched here by the prominent women. (b) He amplifies the
charge: the outward offences of verses 14-15 are matched by an
arrogant, self-indulgent spirit most plainly exhibited by Zion’s
a7
ISAIAH 3:16 — 4:1
daughters; the way in which he moves from the ‘daughters’ (16—
24) to Zion herself (25) indicates that the womenfolk encapsulate
the spirit of the city. (c) He affirms the exactitude of divine
judgment: in verses 16-17 the Lord describes pride and threatens
judgment; his judgment takes the form of removal (18-23),
replacement (24) and destitution (25 — 4:1). Five times the knell
of instead of sounds (24) as the manifestations of haughtiness
give way to dire equivalents. (d) He creates a bridge over to what
he wishes to say next (4:4), for he has in mind that, where sin
abounded, grace will much more abound. 16-17. Haughty as they were, they used every art of manner
(16cde) and ornament (16f) to be sexually attractive. Their
pampered bodies will yet attract attention in a different way:
sores, related.to the word that Leviticus 13:2 uses of leprous
tissue, but here maybe referring to evidences of malnutrition in
siege conditions. Scalps bald is an uncertain translation. The verb
(V‘ard) is never used of ‘stripping’ off hair, and scalps is no more
than an interpretative guess. The phrase could equally be
interpreted ‘expose their private parts’, the dreadful fate awaiting
them when the city falls.
18-23. Crescent necklaces (18): possibly ‘lucky charms’
related to a moon god. Perfume bottles (20), literally ‘houses of
soul/throat’, are more likely ‘high collars’.
24-26. Of the stated replacements, only branding is not
associated with mourning. In verse 25 your ... your is feminine
singular. Isaiah has moved from the daughters to the mother, Zion
herself, watching her sons fall in battle. This continues into verse
26. Gates: the gate was the centre of the life of the city. The
lamenting ‘gate’ is the city’s broken heart, overwhelmed by the mounting casualty lists. 4:1. In 3:6 the men ‘take hold of’ (Vfapas) a man, seeking a
ee ut 4:1 the women take hold of (Nhdzaq) a man, seeking a usband.
v. The greatness that is ‘yet to be’ (4:2-6). Notice the sequence formed by the three in that day statements (3:18; 4:1 and 2). The day of the Lord will see sin end in blighting and death, but that is neither the only nor the last word: the ‘daughters of Zion’ merited judgment on their pride (3:16) but will experience cleansing from the same Lord acting in the same spirit of judgment and ... fire (4:4). Since 2:5, Isaiah has emphasized the social and religious side of Zion’s failure. Now, in this wonderful poem, he indicates a true society with a true religion brought about by a cleansing (4:4) and creative (5) act of
58
ISAIAH 4:2
God. In their humiliation the ‘daughters’ were willing to settle for
a travesty of marriage (4:1) but the Lord designs for them a bridal
canopy of unimaginable splendour (4:5). ‘In [Christ] the sons of
Adam boast/More blessings than their father lost’.! The poem is
built on three pairs of matching themes: it begins with the Lord’s
Branch (2) and ends with the Lord’s booth (6), two distinct
provisions made for Zion’s people; next it designates the Lord’s
people as holy (3) and bridal (5); and at its centre there is the
double divine act of cleansing (4) and creation (5).
2. Many interpreters understand Branch ... fruit as lookin
forward to the earth’s abundant fertility in the messianic Day?
(cf, e.g., Je. 31:12; Joel 3:18; Am. 9:13). This is one aspect of the
Old Testament’s view of creation: just as sin brought a curse on
the earth whereby it would henceforth yield its goodness only
grudgingly (Gn. 3:17—19), so the day will come when the curse
will be no more (Rev. 21:3-—5) and the new creation will explode
in bounty. This richness, therefore, is not ‘pie in the sky by and
by’ but a messianic expectation based on the removal of sin and
its curse by the Messiah. Zechariah 3:8—10 links the removal of
iniquity and the enjoyment of peace and plenty with the ‘bringing
forth’ of ‘My servant, the Branch’. In other words, ‘Branch’ is a
messianic title (Je. 23:5; 33:15; Zc. 3:8; 6:12), and the view taken
here is that Isaiah 4:2 marks its: earliest occurrence. The
references show that the title ‘Branch’ (semah)’ is used to point to
the Messiah’s kingly and priestly offices, but in itself ‘branch’ is
a ‘family tree’ motif indicating the Messiah’s ancestry. To
Jeremiah, he is David’s Branch, tracing his human ancestry back
to the great king (cf Is. 11:1, using different words but the same
idea). Isaiah sees him as ‘The Lord’s Branch’, ie. in some
unexplained way he has a divine ancestry also. The fruit of the
land could, of course, refer to the messianic abundance, but we
ought to notice that here it is associated directly with the Branch
of the LORD as jointly providing (lit.) ‘adornment and glory ...
pride and beauty for the escaped company of Israel’. It is
suitable, therefore, to understand fruit of the land as indicating
the human origin of the Messiah, in the same way as ‘a root out
of dry ground’ in 53:2. His gifts to his people are ‘adornment’
(beautiful) and ‘beauty’ (glory), i.e. personal distinctiveness and
attractiveness, in contrast to the false, deceptive beauty of 3:18;

Testamentum 14 (1964), pp. 93ff.
29
ISAIAH 4:3-6 P
‘glory’ (glorious) and pride point to a great change. ‘Glory’ ha
ee ie (3:8) and ‘pride’ their ruin (2:11-12),
but now the divine glory will dwell among them (see on 5) and
they will rightly pride themselves in him. Survivors: ‘escapees’,
those who (by whatever means) have escaped from a calamity
which has taken others.
3. The ‘escapees’ of verse 2 are described as those who are left
and remain. They are not, however, what they were; they are
holy, altered in status and transformed in character (see on 6:3),
and this by the will of God, for they are recorded among the living or better ‘written unto life’, destined for life, registered in
the Lord’s book (e.g. Ex. 32:32-33; Lk. 10:20; Phil. 4:3; Rev.
33539129): f 4. Their transformation into holiness is now explained. Filth
... bloodstains: the former word means ‘vomit’, Ze. inner uncleanness; the latter, the outward marks of a wrong life (1:15).
The Agent, applying this cleansing, is the Spirit (NIV mg.; cf esp.
63:10—14), acting with judgment and fire. The Lord so acts by his
Spirit as to meet the objective requirements of his absolute justice
and the subjective requirements of his own holy nature, for
burning and fire are symbols of divine holiness (Ex. 3:5; 19:10—- 25):
5. The Lord also provides the perfect environment for those
whom (4) he has cleansed: a new act of creation. Create (Vbara’)
is used in the Old Testament only of acts of God, things which by
their greatness or newness or both absolutely require a divine
agent. This supreme new reality is the Lord’s own presence,
signalled by the ancient symbols of cloud ... by day ... fire by
night (Ex. 13:21—22; 19:18). His presence is of the most intimate
nature, for over all the glory will be a canopy. Canopy (hupp4) is
the ‘marriage chamber’ in Psalm 19:6 and Joel 2:16, the canopy
providing privacy as bridegroom and bride come together in love
and union. Glory is either the Messiah united in love with his
bride-people, or the holy people of Zion joined in consummated
love with the Lord under the overshadowing tokens of his presence.
6. In the old Tabernacle days, the Lord was present with his people (Ex. 29:43-46) but his Tent was closed to them (Ex. 40:34-35). Not so any longer! The overshadowing fiery cloud of the divine presence, the bridal canopy, will be shelter ... shade ... refuge ... hiding-place. The doubling of words is deliberate, conveying the idea of ‘every possible protection’. Likewise the contrast of heat with storm and night with day implies ‘in every circumstance and threat’ and ‘at all times’.
60
ISAIAH 5:1-2d
d. Grace exhausted (5:1-30)
The third movement_of Isaiah’s e (see p. 42 above) is continuous with the previous two but raises a wholly new
prospect: it sounds no note of hope. We saw how, in 1:25-26,
against all deserving and indeed against the customary use of the
expression turn my hand, the Lord forecast his work of royal
restoration; likewise in 3:16 — 4:1 the pride of the daughters of
Zion certainly receives its due but judgment does not have the
last word: where sin abounded, grace superabounded (4:4). It is
not unfitting to use the word ‘grace’, expressing as it does a total
mercy to the totally undeserving. But picture the situation should
even divine grace be exhausted!
Isaiah reaches this point in the Song of the Vineyard (1-7). In
1:8 the vineyard reference was associated with the Lord’s
preservation of a remnant of Zion; in 3:15, when the vineyard
was under threat from self-seeking rulers, the Lord as Judge
intervened on behalf of his vineyard-people. But in 5:4 the
vineyard is the place where the Lord asks if there is anything
more he could have done. A total gra xpended but
only with the result of inedi s. If the Lord has nothing
more that he can do, what price hope? Chapter 5 therefore calls in
question the bright expectations sketched in the first two sections
of the preface and foresees only darkness ... distress ... light ...
darkened (30).
Between the song (1-7) and the darkness (30), Isaiah spells
out the grim reality of the inedible grapes (8—25) in six ‘woes’. It
is not the Lord’s way to pass and execute judgment without
enquiring into the facts, nor to spring judgment on those who
deserve it without alerting them to its cause.
i. A total work and a total loss (5:1-7). lab. The recurrence
of the vineyard-motif in these chapters and elsewhere (27:2-6;
Je. 12:7-10; cf. Ps. 80:8; Je. 2:21) suggests that it was a familiar
usage. When Isaiah announced, then, that he was about to ‘sing
about my loved One, my Beloved’s song about his vineyard’ (1),
listeners would gather expectantly — and for a while their happy
expectations were realized. 1c—2d. The various actions of the owner are not allegories of
specific aspects of the Lord’s care for his people; they are the
typical acts of viticulture designed to make the single point that
nothing was left undone to guarantee a sound crop. Isaiah’s
Beloved had great expectations of his vineyard. He built a
watchtower, not a temporary hut (1:8); winepress should be
61
ISAIAH 5:2e-7
‘wine-vat’, for storage of the crop — and cut in the rock for
permanency. ; 2ef. All this caring work issued in hope: he looked for.a_crop.
But instead of grapes all it yielded was bad fruit (lit. ‘stinkfruit’). Every care had been lavished, but yet the vine retained its
natural wildness — as if grace had never touched it.
3-4. In true prophetic fashion Isaiah speaks in the person of
his Beloved and, as Jesus will do in his vineyard parable (Mk.
12:9), by making his hearers both judge and jury in the matter, begins to manoeuvre them toward self-condemnation. What more could have heen done «.. ?: this is the sobering question central to
this section of Isaiah’s preface: if divine power, wisdom and
obligation have exhausted themselves, what hope can remain?
5—6. Failure to fulfil the owner’s intention brought the fourfold
danger of divine antagonism (J will), dominant external foes
(destroyed ... trampled), rampant alien growth (driers ... thorns)
and deprivation of the means of life and fertility (no rain).
7. The Lord’s joy and sorrow in his ‘vineyard-people’, plain
throughout the song, comes to a climax. Delight (Sa“siu‘im): only
here in Isaiah, an intensiv rmation, ‘his intense pleasure’.
Fruitlessness does not merely violate the Lord’s formal intention,
it contradicts his heart. Justice is miSpal, bloodshed is minal The meaning is uncertain but these two words look and soun
almost identical! Kidner suggests ‘he looked for right but,
behold, riot’? — in the sense of moral and social anarchy. Likewise righteousness is s‘daga@ and cri istress is s°‘aqa. The
facade was in place, but they were violating the Lord’s norms in
both practice inciple (justice ... righteousness, see 1:21), a NE <r ore eee (bloodshed ...
cries).
ii. The stink-fruit harvest and its consequence (5:8-30).
Isaiah spells out the ill fruit of the vineyard in six ‘woes’ (8, 11,
18, 20, 21, 22). The first two (8-12) deal with abuse of the
material benefits of life, and the consequences are drawn out in two therefore sections (13, 14-17). The second series of four woes (18-23) deals with violation of the moral and spiritual obligations of life, and it too is followed by two therefore sections (24, 25-30). As we will see, the first therefore in each case (13, 24) is short and specifies how the coming judgment matches the foregoing sin; the second therefore is longer and forecasts total judgment, death (13) and destruction (25-30). This is a good place to note how measured and reasoned Isaiah was in his ministry — and this applies to all the prophets. Any tendency
62
ISAIAH 5;8—13
to think of them as condemnatory demagogues, ranting and
rebuking, fails to observe how they ministered on the basis of
indisputable evidence (the ‘woes’) and then carefully drew out
logical, inescapable conclusions (the ‘therefores’).
8. It may help us to see the balanced coherence of Isaiah’s
exposure of sin if we number this first ‘woe’ Al, and note how it
is balanced by the sixth (22-23; A2). Isaiah starts with property
acquisition and ends with money acquisition. In Israel land was a
sacred entity. It belonged to the Lord, and his people were his
‘resident aliens and settlers’ (Lv. 25:23). The intention was that
each family’s holding would remain within the family (Lv. 25;
Nu. 27:1—11). But land speculation was rife in Isaiah’s day (cf
Mi. 2:2; Am. 2:6—8) and he gives us a picture of the wealthy
creating large estates, centred on the ‘big house’ without a
smallholder in sight. The squire, living alone in the land, is
monarch of all he surveys. Add house to house: building on to an
originally smaller house to create a mansion.
9-10. The NIV has smoothed out a very exclamatory piece of
Hebrew with the help of 22:14 but, of itself; verse 9a reads ‘In
my ears! Yahweh of hosts!’ The exclamation affirms direct,
verbal revelation. But beyond even this vital truth there is the
manifestation of heaven’s outrage in the explosive quality of the
exclamation. A bath, about six gallons, was a meagre yield for
ten acres — ‘ten yokes’, usually understood as the area ten oxen
could plough in a day. A homer was equivalent to ten ephahs, so
that the yield envisaged here is one tenth of the seed sown. An
ephah was equal to a bath in dry measure. Isaiah saw that the
character and conduct of the owners would cause a retrenchment
in what the created world is prepared to do for them.
11-12. The second ‘woe’ (B1), self-indulgence, is matched by
the fifth (21; B2) which deals with self-importance. Their whole
regard is for partying (11—12b), they have no regard for what the
Lord is doing (12cd).
13. The short therefore takes up the preceding themes: landgrabbing (8) replaced by exile; alcoholic indulgence (11) by
thirst. Those who blinded themselves to spiritual perception (12)
go into exile for lack of understanding. How exact and evenhanded the Lord is! Will go is a Hebrew ‘perfect’ tense and could
express ‘have gone’ (i.e. their captivity has already taken place;
they are slaves to greed and appetite), or ‘are doomed to go’.
Isaiah lived in times of great powers on the march (see
Introduction, pp. 19-23), and it was a real contemporary
possibility that little Judah would be swallowed up. Exile is too
precise a translation, suggesting a prediction of the Babylonian
63
ISAIAH 5: 14-19
exile yet to come. All Isaiah forecasts here is ‘captivity’, loss of
their land and liberty to superior force. ;
14. The grave should be ‘Sheol’ (NIV mg.), the ‘place name of
the abode of the dead (cf. 14:9-15) pictured here as an insatiable
monster into which all descend. The additional description
brawlers and revellers is neither an irrelevance nor a mere poetic
elaboration. This was the character of those Isaiah saw around
him (11-12). They go down into death unchanged; they enter
Sheol in the character they forged on earth, still spiritually
insensitive and all-unready to meet God. ai att
15-16. Holy (qdado§) is the adjective describing the divine
nature itself. In Genesis 38:21, a woman considered to belong
wholly to the god she served is described as ‘holy’ (q“désa), part
of the divine order of things. The word itself probably means
‘separate’ (see 6:3), but in the case of the God of the Bible what
constitutes his distinctiveness and makes him separate is his
moral reality. His exaltation is simply the manifestation of what
has always been true of him, his holiness exerting itself in
righteousness and in justice. God is here the noun ’él, mostly
used of God in his divine transcendence. 17. The rich, literally ‘well-fed’ (cf 11), created their vast and
very private estates (8). These have now passed into new
ownership, sheep ... in their own pasture. All the expenditure and
effort now lies in ruins, a grim inclusio to the designer-emptiness
of verse 8! Verse 17 may look like an idyllic pastoral scene; it is
actually the empty achievement of human vanity; the net profit of
pride. Lambs translates a needlessly altered Hebrew text which
reads ‘(passing) strangers’. If we translated it ‘tramps’ it would give the right feeling here.
Verses 18-23 contain the second series of ‘woes’ (see p. 62),
which exposes Isaiah’s people as morally and _ spiritually
indifferent (18-19), reversing moral values (20), recognizing no
authority but themselves (21), no glittering prizes but those
awarded for indulgence (22), and no obligations save to work the system for self-advantage (23). This frightening list poses the five
questions by which the graph of collapsing human character can
be traced: is sin abhorred or relished (18)? Is God reverenced or flouted (19)? Are moral values seen as objective absolutes or as subjective preferences (20)? Where is the authority which governs life thought to reside (21)? What excites admiration in human achievement (22)? Does the social system guarantee the punishment of guilt and the vindication of innocence (23)? 18-19. The two ‘woes’ in verses 18-19 and 20 can be classed as Cl and C2, united in their respective themes of sin pursued
64
ISAIAH 5:20-24
and sin justified. They form the heart of Isaiah’s description of
the crop of ‘stink-fruit’, the place that people give to morality and
God (C1), and how they define moral authority (C2). Isaiah
pictures people harnessed to sin, like animals harnessed to carts.
Thus they are the voluntary practitioners of a sinful lifestyle but,
as such, they are living an animal existence beneath their true
dignity as humans and, as victims of sin’s deceit (cf. Eph. 4:23;
Heb. 3:13), they are involved in an increasing bondage as the
movement from cords to ropes indicates. Sin ... wickedness: the
former (‘aw6n) stresses the inward reality of sin in human nature;
the latter (hatta’d) the specific ways in which sin is actually
committed (see on 6:7). By a natural progression (cf 12),
devotion to sinfulness (18) leads to the spiritual arrogance that
refuses trust (19a—c) and demands proof (19d-f). Unable to grasp
what the Lord is doing, they refuse the way of patient faith,
awaiting his time; so they say, Let God hurry ... hasten and, until
God acts visibly to their satisfaction, they suspend belief. They
are determined only to know when they see. This is, of course, a
plain challenge to Isaiah’s whole affirmation of the divine
promises and his call to a position of trust, patiently waiting until
the Lord prove as good as his word.
20. The moral code has been rewritten. People no longer feel
guilty when they depart from what was once considered right.
Just as ‘one man’s meat is another man’s poison’, so personal
taste now rules supreme; if a course of behaviour seems bitter or
sweet to someone, then that’s what it is.
21 (B2; cf 11-12). Everything is reduced to individual
reaction and opinion.
22-23 (A2; cf. 8-10). Once more Isaiah insists that bodily
indiscipline (22) has its counterpart in moral obtuseness (22).
Champions is (lit.) ‘men of substance’, meaning here
‘worthwhile people’. But what a standard by which to measure
worth! Can he hold his drink (22a)? Is he a good hand with a
cocktail shaker (22b)? And yet these are the nation’s judges (23)!
24. The punishment will fit the crime (cf 13). They invited the
Lord to hurry (19); their downfall will be like fire racing through
straw. Verses 25-30 raise various literary questions (see on p. 91).
Earthquake (25) and storm (30), those two manifestations of
divine presence and power (e.g. Ex. 19:18-19; Ps. 18:7-15),
provide the brackets within which divine rage is expressed by
means of another force that the Lord commands (26-29), the
irresistible invader. Here is total judgment, matching the long
‘therefore’ of verses 14-17.
65
ISAIAH 5:25—30
25. The created world, with all the immense forces contained
in it, is a controlled tool in the hands of the Creator to serve his
righteous purposes. The verbs could be understood as past tenses
— maybe the earthquake of Amos 1:1 and Zechariah 14:5,
possibly within Isaiah’s memory.
26-28. In verse 25 ‘natural’ powers expose how vulnerable we
are; now Isaiah proceeds to uncover the inner workings of history
(cf. 10:5-15). The Lord’s merest gesture (banner ... whistles)
guarantees that, without delay (26cd), even those strongest in
person (27) and most potent in military equipment (28) come to
do his will. The cynical request that the Lord hurry up (19) finds
its nemesis in the swift onset (28cd) of the invader.
29-30. Pictures of the irresistible predator (29) and the
inescapable storm (30) complete Isaiah’s forecast of doom. Lion
. young lions: the double description (cf 3:1) expresses
comprehensiveness — every possible predator. The second word
means lions in their prime strength. Grow! (Vnaham) is the
satisfied growl of the lion munching its prey. In Isaiah’s ear this
becomes (30) the ‘growl ... growling’ (NIV roar ... roaring) of a
storm, as he moves to his second picture in which day becomes
darkness and the storm-bound sailor, looking hopefully at the
land as a place of escape, finds that, even should he reach shore,
only distress and clouds await him. Thus the passage ends with
the same relentless hopelessness that has characterized it
throughout! Hope has vanished. In other words the third movement of Isaiah’s preface works according to its own logic. If there
is nothing left for God and grace to do (4), then the light has
indeed gone out. It looks as if the sad tale of the failure of the
people of God (see 1:2—24; 2:6 — 4:1) has reached its appropriate
terminus, and as if the flashes of hope which marked the first two
movements of the preface (1:25-27; 4:2-6) were no more than ‘might have beens’. But can it be really so?
II. LIGHT BEYOND THE DARKNESS: THE COMING KING (6 - 12)
Isaiah has now established the backdrop against which he worked as_a prophet. The people to whom he was sent were the heirs of great promises but appear to have forfeited them. By the end of his prefatory chapters, darkness has closed in upon them. Grace has been exhausted; nothing but judgment lies ahead. As we shall see, this is the position which Isaiah sketches in a very dramatic way in 6:1, but by the end of this section, darkness (6:1) has been replaced by singing (12:2, 5) and salvation (12:2-
66
ISAIAH 6 — 12
3), and the Lord in all his holiness (6:1—3) is dwelling in Zion in
the midst of his people (12:6). Darkness and judgment, then, do
not, after all, have the last word. Far from it, for the very promises that appeared to have been forfeited — the David-promises
of 1:25-27 and the Zion-promises of 4:2-6 — are the very things
that come to pass (9:1—7; 11:1-9; 12:1-6). The exhausting of
grace (5:4) has been superseded by the triumph of grace.
How then does Isaiah present this surprising hope, the
dawning of the great light beyond the darkness, the coming
King? The section falls into three parts. It opens with Isaiah’s
account of his experience of the forgiveness of sins at the hands
of the holy God (6:1—7), his call to be a prophet (6:8), and the
strange commission the Lord gave him (6:9-13). This opening is
matched by the song (12:1—6) in which individual (12:1—2) and
community (12:3) enter into salvation through the turning away
of divine anger (12:1), are commissioned to worldwide prophecy
(12:4-5), and have the Holy God dwelling among them (12:6).
This is a very full inclusio, with sin, salvation, commissioning
and divine holiness bracketing the whole section.
Within these brackets, Isaiah first addresses the situation in
Judah (7:1 — 9:7), when King Ahaz faces the crisis of fresh
invasions from the north (see Introduction, pp. 19-20) and decisively rejects the word of God calling him to faith (9:7). In
parallel with this, Isaiah turns to the northern kingdom of Israel
(9:8) where the same tragedy has occurred: the word of God was
sent but was rejected. Isaiah’s addresses to Judah and Israel
follow parallel courses dealing with judgment on disobedience
(7:18 — 8:8; 10:5—15), divine preservation of a believing remnant
(8:9-22; 10:16-34) and the hope of a coming King (9:1-7).
Between the brackets of chapters 6 and 12, the internal chapters 7
— 11 have their own inclusio: 7:1-17, the king who failed and
destroyed the dynasty of David; 11:1-16 the true Davidic King
who will rule over the whole perfected creation.
In this section we find a principle and a problem. The principle
is the place Isaiah accords to hope in the life of the people of
God. He always sees hope for divine action against all the odds
of human merit and deserving (cf 1:25—27; 4:2-6). The bright
future is not brought about by a gradual improvement or by
clever human planning: it is a work of God; it comes as the
outworking of the logic of his faithfulness; it dawns because he is
as true to himself in mercy as he is in judgment. We have seen in
the brief outline above that Isaiah presents two topics in
sequence: the preservation of a believing remnant of the people,
and the bursting-in of the great hope. This is a deliberate
67
ISAIAH 6: 1-13
juxtaposition because, on the one hand, the remnant Is caught up,
inevitably, in the darkness that comes upon the disobedient
people — faith is never a certificate of immunity — but, on the
other hand, in the darkness they have the cordial of hope, the
durability to hold on because of the light which God’s promise
holds before them (cf 2 Cor. 3:12; Col. 1:5; 1 Thes. 1:3:-5:83,2
Thes. 2:15-16). It is for this reason that Isaiah presents the
great hope as if it were about to dawn immediately beyond the
Assyrian darkness (e.g. 8:21 — 9:2; 10:28 — 11:3) — in order that
they might be buoyed up in hope just as Christians are by the
scriptural truth of the imminence of the return of the Lord Jesus.
The problem raised by chapters 6 — 12 is that the message
which the people actually needed to hear is not brought to them.
The whole upshot of the preface (chs. 1 — 5) is that through sin
they are not what they ought to have been (ch. 1), nor what they
were meant to be (chs. 2 — 4), nor what they might have been (ch.
5). It is precisely the answer to this problem that Isaiah discovers
in the Lord’s dealings with him personally (6:1—8). Furthermore,
the inclusio provided by 12:1-6 focuses on this very truth — people who have found comfort in place of divine anger and
rejoice in a God of salvation. So why are chapters 7 — 11 lacking
any message about atonement and forgiveness? The answer is
that Isaiah met people where they were and brought them a
message that they could see as relevant. They were not yet ready
to face their sinfulness and hear a gospel of pardon, but in the.
circumstances of the time (see on 7:1ff.) they could not fail to see
the inadequacies of existing royal leadership and their need for a different, perfect son of David. True prophet that he was, Isaiah
plunged pragmatically into the situation that faced him and
provided both an exact diagnosis of the present and a confident
vision of the future. Yet, returning as he did in chapter 12 to the
‘salvation’ theme of chapter 6, he implies that somehow, within
the promise of the royal Messiah, there lurks the Lord’s answer to
the problem of sin and judgment. In this way Isaiah lays the
foundation on which he will presently build the theology and prediction of atonement which we find in chapters 40 — 55, centred on the Servant (53:13) who is also David (55:3).
a. The individual, atonement and commission (6:1-13)
The topic of this chapter is the call of Isaiah, and for this reason alone it would be a fitting ‘chapter 1’ following the ‘author’s preface’. But like all the prophets who recorded their experience of a call (cf Paul, Gal. 1 — 2), personal facts are told not for their own sake but because they illustrate a vital theme. We come
68
ISAIAH 6:1
nearer to the heart of this chapter by noting that it is pervaded by
the thought of death: the dying king (1), the prophet under
sentence of death (5), the sacrificial animal dead on the altar (6)
and the felled tree (13). Twice over, death seems to spell the end
but is found not to be so. The king lies dead (1) but it turns out to
be only the felling of a tree, and life remains in the root (13);
the prophet lies dead, struck down by sin under divine holiness (5) but when the seraph approaches, apparently bearing the
fire of judgment, it is to apply the efficacy of a sacrifice for sin
and Ls speak the word ‘atoned’ (7). Death does not have the last word.
la. Uzziah reigned for fifty-two prosperous and secure years
(2 Ki. 15:1—7; 2 Ch. 26). By the end of his reign, however, clouds
were gathering: Tiglath-Pileser III of Assyria, who acceded in
745 BC, was an imperialist, and already the small Palestinian
states were feeling the threat. It is tempting to think of Isaiah,
pondering the old king’s death, anxious for the future, being
comforted by the vision of a King who cannot die (cf. the King,
5). But if he was thus reassured by his vision he does not say so.
According to 1:1 Isaiah began his prophetic career ‘during the
reign of’ (lit. ‘in the days of’) Uzziah, i.e. before Uzziah died.
Why, then, does he not date his call, as would be customary, ‘in
the fifty-second year of the reign of Uzziah’? Why does he date
the event by a death? Uzziah had committed a dreadful sin of
trespass (2 Ki. 15:5; 2 Ch. 26:16—-21), intruding into the house of
the Lord where, as a layman, he had no right to go. For this he
fell under divine judgment and for the rest of his reign was
alienated from the worshipping community, under divine
displeasure. When death came, this situation was unresolved. The
king died as he had lived, estranged and unclean. Following on
the darkness with which chapter 5 ended, can we doubt that
Isaiah saw the king as a symbol of the nation? It too had
overstepped the bounds of grace (5:4) and was moving towards
its demise under divine displeasure (5:13-17) and at the hands of
an invincible foe (5:24-30). So has the Lord really come to the
end as far as his people are concerned? In this way chapter 6
takes up the story where chapter 5 left off.
In verses 1b—13a, the symbolism of the dying king (1a) leads
into a tripartite vision of God. First, the Lord’s holiness with its
consequence in Isaiah’s (and his people’s) doom (1b-5); secondly
(6-8), the Lord’s atonement, bringing Isaiah’s cleansing and
restoration; and thirdly, the Lord’s programme (9-13a) and
Isaiah’s ministry within it. 1b. J saw: John 1:18 correctly observes that ‘No-one has ever
69
ISAIAH 6:2-3
seen God’, for God is spirit (31:3; Jn. 4:24). Yet, in condescension, he sometimes clothes himself with visibility for the good of
his people, showing now this side and now that side of his
character (e.g. Jos. 5:13-15). For Isaiah the Lord became visible
in exalted kingliness, with a throne, robes and attendants, all
speaking of sovereign majesty and dominion. High and exalted:
see 52:13; 57:15, where the same words refer respectively to the
Lord’s Servant and the Lord. The reference here also is best taken
as (not to the throne but) to the Lord, high in his own nature, and exalted or ‘lifted up’ by the acknowledgment of his supremacy. Train ... temple: the flowing robes point to the place where the
transcendent Lord touches the earth; the Lord is present in all his
majesty at the centre of his people’s life. The temple is no ‘mere’
symbol. It is where the Lord is (1 Ki. 8:10—13), the indwelling
God (1 Cor. 3:16; 6:19; Eph. 2:19-22). (Cf the ‘footstool’ motif, 1 Ch. 28:2; Ps. 132:7; La. 2:1; Is. 60:13.)
2. Above him: the position of a servant waiting ‘upon’ a
master. The same preposition, ‘over, upon’, occurs in Genesis
18:8 (NIV ‘near’). Seraphs, literally ‘Burning Ones’, are mentioned only here. Fire is the chief symbol of the holiness of God
(Ex. 3:2-5; 19:18). Suitably, therefore, in this context Isaiah
gives the heavenly attendants a title that matches their situation:
with their down-folded and up-stretched wings they look like
huge flames surrounding the throne of the Holy One.' Covered ...
covered, like were flying, are verbs of continuous action. The
wings covered their eyes (for even they must not pry into the
divine, cf Ex. 19:21) but not their ears (for their role is to wait
for the divine word and obey it, Ps. 103:20). The feet are the
organs of activity, of directing life towards goals (Ps. 18:33; Pr.
1:15-16; 4:27). It is impossible to be sure, but perhaps they
covered their feet” to disavow choosing their own path.
3. The continuous song had a single theme: the Lord’s
holiness, concerning which we learn two truths. First, Hebrew
' The verb sarap means ‘to burn’, but a word of the same spelling is used of ‘snakes’ in 30:6. This has misled some (O. Kaiser, Isaiah ] — 12 [SCM, 1963], ad loc.) to think of serpent-guardians of the divine presence — very odd serpents, of course, with hands and feet. In Isaiah’s Hebrew the word s*rapim (‘seraphim’) has no definite article: it is a description, not a title. They were ‘burning ones’ who exercised a ‘burning’ ministry towards the prophet (6). 2 Why did they cover their feet? There is nothing particularly ‘creaturely’ about the foot whereby they should reverently hide their ‘creatureliness’ in the presence of the Creator; ‘feet’ are used as a euphemism for the sexual parts (7:20), but the attribution of sexuality to heavenly beings would be inappropriate. Verses like 52:7 and Pr. 1:15-16 suggest the feet as metaphorical of the direction life takes,
70
ISAIAH 6:4-7
uses repetition to express either a superlative, as when ‘pure
gold’ in 2 Kings 25:15 translates ‘gold gold’, or a totality, as
when ‘full of tar pits’ in Genesis 14:10 translates ‘pits pits’. But
here for the only time in the Hebrew Bible a quality is ‘raised to
the power of three’, as if to say that the divine holiness is so far
beyond anything the human mind can grasp that a ‘supersuperlative’ has to be invented to express it and, furthermore, that this transcendent holiness is the total truth about God. The
holiness word-group (Vgddas) may mean ‘brightness’, the unapproachable God (1 Tim. 6:16; Ps. 104:2) or ‘separatedness’, i.e.
the quality which marks off the divine nature, setting God apart
from all else, making him the Being that he is. His holiness is,
therefore, his unapproachable and unique moral majesty before
which sinful humankind instinctively quakes (Jdg. 6:22; 13:22).
Secondly, just as holiness is the ‘whole truth’ about God himself, so it is the ‘whole truth’ about his immanence in creation: the
whole earth is full of his glory. Holiness is the Lord’s hidden
glory; glory is the Lord’s omnipresent holiness.
4-5. Shook: the customary reaction of the created order to the
presence of the divine (e.g. Ex. 19:18; Ps. 18:7-9). Doorposts ...
thresholds ... smoke: the mere declaration of the Lord’s holiness
is enough to bar entrance and to forbid sight. Isaiah finds himself
totally excluded and recognizes its consequence (J am ruined)
and its cause (unclean lips). Ruined: from Vdamé, ‘to be silent’,
used of the silence brought about by loss (Je. 47:5) or death (Ps.
49:12). To translate ‘silenced’ would be telling in this context:
excluded from the heavenly choir — even from the possibility of
participating in praise from afar. This judgment came about
through the linking of what some might think of as the ‘merest’
sin (unclean lips) with the remotest contact (eves have seen), but
the mixture is fatal. People of unclean lips: why does Isaiah
extend the admission of sin in this way? Possibly it is a further
confession on his part: he so failed to recognize the seriousness
of sins of speech that he failed to separate himself (/ive among)
from such a society; but possibly he is laying down a marker for
the future: if my sin can be forgiven, so can theirs. Maybe, in
retrospect, in his own experience of atonement (6-7) he already
saw the solution to the national darkness of 5:30 and the dawning
of the light of 53:11. The King, the LorD Almighty: literally ‘of
hosts’. It was not a novel revelation of God that proved Isaiah’s
undoing, just a realization of what had always been true, a holy
King, an omnipotent Yahweh, ‘the Holy One of Israel’, to use
Isaiah’s special title for him (see 1:4).
6-7. The Lord has taken the initiative throughout: revealing
71
ISAIAH 6:8
(2-3), excluding (4-5). Now one of the seraphs, who flew only
by divine command, is sent as the messenger of salvation.
Though all else is shrouded from gaze by the excluding cloud,
the means of salvation is left on view — the fire and the altar. Live
coal ... tongs ... altar: the use of tongs shows that this was no
‘pretend’ fire but the real thing. In the Old Testament, however,
fire is not a cleansing agent’ but the expression of the active, even
hostile, holiness of God (Gn. 3:24; Nu. 11:1-3; Dt. 4:12, 33, 36).
This, however, was fire from the altar, the place where holiness
accepted, and was satisfied by, the death of a substitutionary
sacrifice (Lv. 17:11). The Jive coal thus encapsulates the ideas of atonement, propitiation, satisfaction, forgiveness, cleansing and reconciliation, and of these spiritual realities Isaiah, the erstwhile doomed sinner, is left in no doubt when the seraph explains:
‘Behold, as soon as this touched your lips your iniquity went,
and, as for your sin — paid’ by ransom!’ The Lord ministers to us
at the point of felt need (Jips); the effect is instantaneous (the
verbs touched ... taken are co-ordinate perfect tenses); he deals not just with sin as we are aware of it, but as he sees it in us: guilt
or ‘iniquity’ (1:4; 5:18), the inner corruption, sin (1:4, 18; 3:9),
the specific wrong; the basis of atonement is a ‘covering price’. Atoned (kippér): ‘to cover’. Cf. the literal sense in Genesis 6:14
(‘coat it’); the developed meaning of the verb used in atonement theology (kippér) has retained this basic idea, but in the sense
that we speak of the correct sum of money ‘covering’ a debt, i.e.
Bec iein a satisfactory payment (Ex. 21:30; 30:12-16; Nu.
78; 31:50).
8. The immediate effect of atonement is reconciliation. Isaiah
first saw the Lord afar off (1), but now he is near enough to
overhear the divine musing; he had once been ‘silenced’ by sin
(5) but as the redeemed sinner he is free to speak. The God who
shut him out (4) has brought him home. But he finds that being
joined to God means joining a missionary society: he has been brought in in order to be sent out. Us: a plural of consultation (1 Ki. 22:19-23), but the New Testament relates these verses to both the Lord Jesus (Jn. 12:24) and the Holy Spirit (Acts 28:25), thus finding here what will yet accommodate the full revelation of the Holy Trinity.
__.! The only possible reference to cleansing by fire is Nu. 31:21-24, but the insistence of v. 23 on ‘the water of cleansing’ suggests that here also fire symbolizes the active wrath of the holy God. Even on inanimate objects contaminated by Midianite life, that wrath must vent itself before they can pass to Israelite use.
72
ISAIAH 6:9-13a
Verses 9-13a contain the message Isaiah is to convey (9), the
task given him to do (10) and the programme in which he is now involved (11—13a).
9-10. The use of these verses in the New Testament (Mt.
13:14-15; Mk. 4:12; Lk. 8:10; Jn. 12:39-41; Acts 28:26-27)
makes them especially important to understand, but at first sight
what an odd commission they are: to tell people not to understand
(9), yet to make sure that they will not (10)! This is its plain
meaning. It specifies (9) the ‘outer’ (hearing, seeing) and the
“inner” faculties (understanding, i.e. ‘discerning’, and perceiving,
i.e. ‘knowing’) and arranges them (10) into a rounded structure
(heart ... ears ... eyes ... eyes ... ears ... heart) thus emphasizing
total inability to comprehend. The most helpful approach is to ask
how, in the light of his subsequent ministry, Isaiah understood
what he was commanded. The answer lies in 28:9-10, where we
learn that Isaiah presented the truth with such simplicity that the
‘men of the world’ of his day would pack him off to teach
kindergarten! And the whole Isaianic literature bears the same
mark of a plain, systematic, reasoned approach. In other words,
verses 9-10 are a very stark statement of the preacher’s dilemma:
those who resist the truth can be changed only by telling them the
truth, but to do this exposes them to the danger of rejecting the
truth yet once again — and maybe this further rejection will push
them beyond the point of no return and they will become
irretrievably hardened in mind and heart (Heb. 6:4-8). The
human eye cannot see this ‘point of no return’ in advance — nor
necessarily recognize it when it is past, but the all-sovereign God
both knows it and indeed appoints it as he presides, with perfect
righteousness and justice, over the human psychological
processes which he created. It was at just such a time that Isaiah
was called to the prophetic-preaching office and understood what
his terms of commission meant: he was to bring God’s word with
fresh, even unparalleled clarity — for only the truth could win and
change them; but in their negative response his hearers would
pass the point of no return. The opportunity which could spell
their salvation would spell their judgment.
11-13a. The envisaged programme is one of mounting
tragedy: destruction of cities ... houses ... fields (11), deportation
(12) and yet further loss (13a). Assyria is the power threatening
the nation at present, but Isaiah will soon learn that Assyria is not
to be the agent of complete loss. Nevertheless, his prediction was
‘at home’ in its own times. Assyria introduced a policy of
deportation (2 Ki. 17) and Babylon continued it (2 Ki. 24-25). In this way the verses are a prospectus for Isaiah’s book: how the
73
ISAIAH 6:13b
Assyrian threat will come and go (chs. 7 — 37) and how, beyond
that, a darker threat, Babylon, will arise from a profounder cause
(chs. 38 — 48).
13b. Will divine judgment, then, have the last word for the
people with whom Isaiah identified himself (5)? In Isaiah’s case
the ‘Burning One’ approached carrying fire (6) and it must have
seemed to Isaiah that his end had come; but the voice said
‘atoned’ (7). So here the tree lies cut down; but the divine voice
says ‘the holy seed’ (lit. ‘the seed of holiness its stump’). Noting
how this half-verse forms an inclusio with la (the dying king ... the fallen tree), the implication is that the people who carry the promise of the Messiah carry thereby the guarantee of continuing
until he comes. This is the plainest understanding of the words, but Isaiah does use ‘seed’ of the people who will yet enjoy the
promises (41:8; 43:5; 45:25; 53:10; 59:21; 65:9, 23; 66:22), and
the ‘holy seed’ could therefore be the remnant, called holy and
“written unto life’ (4:3) in the Zion that was yet to be (cf Heb. 12:22).
b. Darkness and light in Judah (7:1 — 9:7)
The matching fourfold addresses to Judah and Israel which begin
here (see outline, pp. 66-68) work out the position Isaiah has
now reached. Chapter 5 brought into question the possibility of
future hope, but Isaiah found that question answered both for
himself (6:4-8) and his people (6:13b). Thus a parallel was
established: Isaiah is the model for the future. The word of God is
about to come to king and people (7:1—17) and rejection of it will
bring disaster (7:18 — 8:8), but within a disbelieving people there
will be those who have personally embraced the way of faith and
base their lives on the Lord’s word (8:9—22), and for them there is
light beyond the present enfolding darkness (8:23 — 9:7). Thus
the doctrine of the believing remnant flowers and, alongside it,
the dying Uzziah (6:1) is a foil for the hope with which the subsection ends: the birth of the child with four names (9:6), the
‘holy seed’ (6:13) sprouting from the stump of the felled tree.
i. The moment of decision (7:1-17). The abiding truth of this passage is that faith in the Lord and in his promises is a practical approach to life however great the crisis. To this message Isaiah received as cold a reply from the politicians and people of his day
‘Oe Supports MT, save that it includes a definite article in the expression ‘seed of holiness’. LXx contains no reference to ‘the holy seed’ but would be an unsafe guide, since it diverges from MT throughout this verse (and passage).
74
ISAIAH 7: 1-4
as would be the case today. Practical people, they would say, have to live in the real world Pe eipoticelaasiniciesica | military muscle are what counts. But to Isaiah this was not a choice between viable alternatives. It was a life and death decision.
1-2. Threatened by the expansionist/imperialist policies of
the Mesopotamian power, Assyria, the two major states of
northern Palestine, Aram and Israel, had entered into a defensive
alliance and, considering that an all-Palestine alliance would give
greater collective security, pressed Judah to join. When
diplomacy failed to entice Judah, the northern powers invaded to
force Ahaz’ hand (2 Ch. 28:5-8), but they could not overpower
Jerusalem. A second invasion followed (2 Ch. 28:17—18),
purposing now to replace Ahaz by a puppet king (6). For this
reason Ahaz is described as the house of David, for it is a time of
dynastic threat. What he now does will determine the future of
David’s line. Has allied itself with: the by now ten-year-old
alliance could not be the cause of this fresh panic. The verb
(naha) always (sixty-three times in the Old Testament) has the
meaning given in verse 19, settle or ‘swarm’. This is indeed
frightening news as spies slip back home to say ‘the place is
swarming with them’. Another invasion is impending, causing
king and people to ‘flap’ as the trees of the forest are shaken!
Contrast 28:16, ‘the one who trusts will not panic’ (lit.).
3. Shear-Jashub means ‘a remnant will return’. It is an
ambivalent name: the noun comes first for emphasis, but does it
mean ‘(only) a remnant ...’ or ‘a (guaranteed) remnant ...’? Is ita
threat of decimation or a promise of survival? Isaiah was so sure
on both counts — that unbelief would destroy and faith would
save (see 9) — that he made the word of God ‘become flesh’ in the
person of his son. Ahaz, a man of his time, should have felt the
force of this, but he was otherwise engaged at the aqueduct of the
Upper Pool, trying to secure his water-supply against the coming
siege. For until the time of Hezekiah (22:1—-14), water came to
the city overground and was therefore vulnerable.
4. Be careful, keep calm are two verbs for the price of one: “Be
careful to keep quiet/do nothing’, the second verb being auxiliary to the first (as Gn. 24:6; Dt. 4:9). Ahaz, however, had it in
mind to do plenty. He intended to play the clever politician by
securing Assyria itself as his security against the northern powers
(2 Ki. 16:7-9). Isaiah saw it differently. The aggressor kings
might display ‘flaming anger’ but actually they were only
smouldering stubs, fag-ends! If only Ahaz could be persuaded to
disengage himself from politics, Assyria would in any case
TS
ISAIAH 7:5—9
squash the northern kingdoms and the Lord would preserve Judah
— as indeed he ultimately did (37:36-37). But if Ahaz links
himself to Assyria he will indeed have taken a tiger by the tail! In
all this the issue is clear-cut: is salvation by faith or by works?
Will Ahaz be saved by trust or by astute political gambles?
5~7 describe the plans of men (5-6) and the word of God (7).
Isaiah, feigning not to be able to remember the name of Israel’s
king — ‘His father was Remaliah but for the life of me I can’t
place him!’ — achieves a classical ‘put-down’ and provides a
_ perfect foil for the word of the Sovereign LorD. It is the greatness
of the Lord that makes faith a practical policy in even the hardest
realities of life (see Pr. 16:1, 33). It also leaves unbelief without
excuse.
8-9. These verses are a six-line poem. In lines 1 and 2 (8ab), 4
and 5 (9ab) the northern kingdoms are analysed: the country
(Aram ... Ephraim) is traced to its capital (Damascus ...
Samaria) and up to its king (Rezin ... Remaliah’s son). In lines 3
(8cd) and 6 (9cd) conclusions are drawn: Ephraim is doomed
(shattered); if Ahaz refuses to trust he has no future. As in much
poetry, meaning is expressed allusively rather than directly. First,
there is common sense. You are in a flap because seemingly
powerful nations threaten. Trace them back to source and what
do they amount to? Only Rezin and Remaliah’s son! Secondly,
there is implication. If Ephraim and Aram can be traced back to
source, what of Judah? Its capital is Jerusalem and its king the
Davidic King: the city the Lord chose to dwell in (1 Ki. 11:13),
and the Lord’s king on the Lord’s throne (1 Ch. 29:23), backed
by the all-commanding power of verse 7. Thirdly, there is
warning. Ephraim chose the security of military alliance but time
would demonstrate its folly. The reference is to 671 BC when
Esarhaddon of Assyria, by importing foreign settlers (2 Ki.
17:24; 2 Ch. 33:11; Ezr. 4:2), put an end to all hope of reviving
the old northern kingdom. Suppose, then, Judah goes the way of
alliance? This leads to a stark choice: Stand firm in your faith ...
not stand at all (9)! NIV reflects the telling rhyme by which Isaiah
links these two lines (ta’“minii ... te’aménii). Crudely, ‘Trust or
bust’ — a paraphrastic rendering as shocking as the original is blunt. Ahaz stands at the point of no return (see on 6:9-11). Verses 10-17 do not indicate whether this second message to Ahaz took place at the same time and place as the first or not (1). Verses 10-12 relate the attempt to move Ahaz to a position of faith; verses 13-16 denunciate Ahaz as the betrayer of his dynasty’s most treasured hope; and verses 16-17 foretell the consequent calamity: a disaster greater than 1 Kings 12:16.

ISAIAH 7:10-14
10. The human messenger is forgotten. The prophet’s word is
the Lord’s word; the Lord’s word is the prophet’s word (see 13).
This is the uniqueness of verbal inspiration and the marvel of
Holy Scripture.
11-12. The sin of putting the LORD to the test is refusing to trust him and his past faithfulnesses unless he prove himself
trustworthy all over again. The situation is transformed when the
Lord proffers a sign. On his side nothing is more important than
that his promises are met by trust. Therefore he is ready to go to
deepest depths ... highest heights to help, even to make Ahaz
take up a position of faith as the solution to the crisis. Pious
ough his words sound, Ahaz is doing the devil’s work of
quoting Scripture for his own purposes and thereby displaying
himself as the dogmatic unbeliever. This was his moment of
decision, his point of no return.
13. House of David: the dynasty is at stake. Try the patience:
the verb is plural. From the start David’s house has not fulfilled
its divine remit, producing neither the perfect king nor the golden
age. It has failed both men and God, but now this whole history
of inadequacy has come to a head. The royal refusal of trust is the
end of the line. For this reason the prophet can speak of my God
but he cannot repeat the your God of verse 10.
14. Against the background of divine exasperation (13) and
the change from ‘your God’, therefore draws a conclusion: the
sign he proposes is no longer a movement of grace opening a
door of faith to the king (10) b i e spelling out the dire result of his faithlessness. But can the sign
itself be of less magnitude than the promise to ‘move heaven and
earth’ (11), especially since its giver is the LorD himself
(“donay, ‘the Sovereign One’)? The virgin (ha‘almd): it is
widely urged that, had Isaiah intended virgo intacta (as Mt. 1:23,
25 understood him to mean), he would not have used ‘alma but
b°tild and that, by using ‘alma, he meant no more than a ‘young
woman’ who, since she was to become pregnant, must charitably
be assumed to be married. But it is argued here that Isaiah did
indeed intend virgo intacta (see Additional Note, pp. 78-79).
Be with child ... give birth: cf. Genesis 16:11; Judges 13:5.
The expression is ‘timeless’, with the context deciding in each
case. Immanuel: ‘God with us’ (NIV mg.). The case for expecting
a divine Messiah is strong in the Old Testament and was, in fact,
Jesus’ understanding (Mt. 22:41—45). It is clear that at some point the expectations originating in 2 Samuel _7 developed into_the
hope of a perfect King who would reign universally for ever (9:7)
and who would be both son of David and Son of God (see on 4:2;
77
ISAIAH 7:15-17
Pss. 2:7; 45:6; cf, Acts 13:33; Rom. 1:4; Heb. 1:5; 5:5). The view
that the ‘alma means, collectively, the young marrieds of Judah,
who in the coming troubles would either express faith by naming
their sons ‘God is with us’ or voice prayer by naming them ‘God
be with us’, must surely be doubted. The you (pl.) to whom the
Sovereign One gives this sign is the ‘house of David’,
represented by Ahaz. In what sense would a rash of little
Immanuels, which Ahaz would dismiss as women’s hysteria,
constitute a heaven-sent sign, matching the momentousness of
this passage, or prepare for the developing Immanuel-theme
through 8:8 into 9:6? ;
15-17. Isaiah now allows Ahaz to believe that the birth of Immanuel is imminent and does so for a reason that hindsight justifies. Wrong ... right: at most this means reaching the ‘years
of discretion’ when moral choices are understood; but it could
simply mean knowing the difference between nice and nasty
tastes — a very early experience. The vagueness is deliberate, but
three things are affirmed: (1) the child will grow up in poverty
(15), for curds and honey, as verse 22 shows, are the diet of those
left in a devastated land; (2) the northern threat from Aram and
Israel will be ended (16) — and indeed Damascus fell to Assyria
three years and Samaria thirteen years later; and (3) huge disaster
would fall on the house of David (17). The separation of Ephraim
(1 Ki. 12:20) reduced David’s kingdom to a tiny remainder. The coming of the king of Assyria would take even this from David:
the semblance of monarchy would survive for another century but the reality would never be restored. This was indeed the case: from the time when Ahaz disbelieved, he and David’s
descendants reigned as puppet kings, by courtesy first of Assyria
and then of Babylon, until the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC
extinguished kingdom and monarchy altogether so that (with
Christian hindsight), when Immanuel was born, the heir to
David’s throne was an unknown carpenter in Nazareth (Mt.
1:16)! Thus Isaiah concertinas the centuries, for when Immanuel
was born he inherited only the memory of a kingdom and a nonexistent crown — and it was Ahaz’ fault. As we shall see, in the course of this section Isaiah adjusts the historical perspective (e.g. 9:1), but he uttered no lie when he made Immanuel the immediate heir of the Ahaz-débacle.
Additional Note on the term ‘virgin’ in Isaiah 7:14
On the assumption that the Bible is the best evidence for the meaning of its words, we note that b°ti/d occurs fifty times. Of
78
ADDITIONAL NOTE
these, twelve are metaphorical (e.g. 37:22) and fourteen are
general, where (e.g. Ps. 148:12) ‘young men and maidens’ is
equivalent to ‘young people’ and there is no more ground for
demanding that the ‘maidens’ are unmarried than that the men in
question (bahirim) must be bachelors. There are twenty-one
cases (such as Ex. 22:16; Dt. 22:19) where the b°ti/a in question
would be, or be assumed to be, a virgin, but the requirement is in
the context, not in the word itself. The idea is ‘of marriageable
age/ready for marriage’.
By contrast ‘alma is found only eight other times. Of these,
1 Chronicles 15:20 and Psalm 46 (title) use the word in a musical
direction that is no longer surely understood. Three further
references are indeterminate. It is hard to see that the tambourinegirls (Ps. 68:25) would have to be specified as unmarried; in
Proverbs 30:19 many commentators hold that the reference is to
the mysteries of procreation, though it more reasonably suggests
the often much less explicable matter of sexual attraction! Song
1:3 is more likely to mean ‘unmarried girls’ looking for a good
match than the longing gaze of ‘young married women’! But
Genesis 24:43, Exodus 2:8 and Song 6:8 refer unquestionably to
unmarried girls. Genesis 24 is particularly important as bringing
‘alma and b‘tild together. Abraham’s servant prays (24:14) for a
‘girl’ (na‘“rd) to marry Isaac; the approaching Rebekah (24:16) is
described as female (na‘“rda), of marriageable age (b°tild) and
single (‘no man had ever lain with her’). It is important to note
that b°tila is not sufficient by itself to denote virginity but needs
the explanatory qualification (‘no man ...’). Finally (24:43), in
the light of the knowledge of Rebekah that he has thus
accumulated, the servant describes her as ‘alma — i.e. female,
marriageable and unmarried.
In the light of this there is no ground for saying that ‘alma
must mean ‘young woman’ and that b‘tild is the technical word
for ‘virgin’. Rather, to the contrary: Isaiah used the word which,
among those available to him, came nearest to expressing ‘virgin
birth’ and which, in the event, with linguistic propriety,
accommodated that meaning. It is also worth noting that outside
the Bible, ‘so far as may be ascertained’, ‘alma is ‘never used of a married woman’.'
1E, J. Young, Studies in Isaiah (Tyndale Press, 1954), pp. 171ff. See also
G. J. Wenham, ‘A Girl of Marriageable Age’, Vetus Testamentum 22 (1972), pp.
325ff. Wenham concludes that bila has no more reference to virginity than the English word ‘girl’, and he cannot find evidence for it as a technical term for
‘virgin’ before the Christian era.

ISAIAH 7:18 — 8:1
ii. Divine judgment (7:18 — 8:8). Those who hate wisdom
love death (Pr. 8:36). With open eyes Ahaz rejected the way of
faith. What follows is full of biblical logic. The programme has
been fixed in verses 15-17: the decay of the countryside, the
elimination of the northern powers and the Assyrian domination
of Judah. Ahaz did not act ‘unwisely’ — he used every political
skill, the garnered astuteness of years of diplomacy and worldly
savoir-faire — it was just the wrong wisdom. The very things he
trusted guaranteed calamity. Assyria dominates this section (7:18,
20; 8:4, 7). This is what Ahaz trusted and it will be his ruin.
The section is made up of four in that day oracles (18-19, 20,
21-22, 23-25) and two The LORD said/spoke oracles (8:1,
5-8). 18-20. The conquest will be complete: the land occupied (18—
19), the people humiliated (20). Whistle: even superpowers are at
the Lord’s beck and call, Egypt to the south and Assyria from the
north. Flies ... bees: the Nile inundation annually brought
swarms of flies; Assyria was well known for apiculture. Streams
(y°’orim): a technical word for Egypt’s irrigation canals. In verse
20 the blight on the land (18) is matched by the humbling of the
people. Hired: Ahaz paid tribute to Assyria in return for the
promise of protection (2 Ki. 16:7-8; 2 Ch. 28:21). Shave is
indicative of the indignities heaped on a subject people. Legs:
literally ‘feet’, a euphemism for private parts (1 Sa. 23:3). The
contrast between head and ‘feet’, the visible and hidden body
hair, expresses totality. No part of the land (18) and no part of the
person (19) will escape the hand of the enemy. And the Lord
would have saved Ahaz for nothing! But, instead, worldly
wisdom made him buy salvation — only to find he was paying barber’s charges!
_21-25 take the same two topics in reverse order. The people
will be left in poverty (21-22) and the land in decay (23-25). Not
enough labour will be left for arable farming and people will
have to live off animal husbandry (21-22). Abundance (22) is surely ironic!
In 8:1-8, Isaiah turns to the course the conquest will take, first the time-scale (1-3), then the progress of the Assyrian invasion (6-7) through the northern territories of Aram (Rezin) and Israel (the son of Remaliah), and then flooding into Judah to its virtual destruction (8). 1. Scroll: the word is translated in 3:23 as ‘mirrors’. The meaning here must be some ‘plain surface’ for writing. In 30:8 the parallel idea suggests something like ‘placard’ or ‘hoarding- space’. Ordinary pen: i.e. in ordinary writing, such as anyone can

ISAIAH 8:2-6
read. Publicity is ‘the name of the game’. The name MaherShalal-Hash-Baz is impressionistic rather than grammatical:
“‘Speed-Spoil-Haste-Booty’. It is intended to provoke interest,
leaving unanswered questions, but ‘spoil’ and ‘booty’ would
suggest the invading foe, while ‘speed’ and ‘haste’ suggest unhindered advance: no thought of a fight ahead, only of the spoil awaiting.
2. Uriah ... Zechariah (see 2 Ki. 16:10-16; 18:2): contemporary notables who would subsequently vouch for the date the placard was posted.
3-4. Once more the word is about to become flesh (cf. 7:3) in
the birth of Isaiah’s second son. The LORD said: not until the boy
was born did Isaiah himself understand the significance of what
he had done. He simply walked in obedience, a model for the
people of God. Now he knows that, in recording the incident, he
must entitle his wife the prophetess, because she has been
literally the bearer of the word of the Lord. The opening ‘For’ of
verse 4 should be restored. This is the explanation: the boy is a
time-indicator of what his name foreshadows. Derek Kidner explains the significance of Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz to perfection: ‘The sign of Immanuel ... although it concerned ultimate
events, did imply a pledge for the immediate future, in that
however soon Immanuel were born, the present threat would
have passed before he could be even aware of it. But the time of
his birth was undisclosed; hence the new sign is given, to deal
only with the contemporary scene.’' Before the boy knows is
identical with 7:16 and links this little boy with Immanuel, from
whom he took over the task of being an immediate timeindicator. Like Immanuel (9:6) he has four names, but he
presages doom while the former focuses hope. Thus Isaiah is
able, presently (9:1), to date Immanuel’s coming ‘in the
afterwards’. My father: in nine months to a year. In 734 BC
Tiglath-Pileser marched down the Israelite sea coast as far as the
Egyptian border. Egyptian aid was thus cut off. In 733 BC Israel
lost Galilee, Transjordan (2 Ki. 15:29), Megiddo and other cities,
and only the prompt submission of Hoshea gave the kingdom a
few years more. Damascus fell in 732 BC. Verses 5-8 elaborate 7:17, just as verses 1-4 ‘adjusted’ 7:16:
the Assyrian domination of Israel (6-7) is a prelude to its
domination of Judah (8).
6. This people as an expression is used of Judah, e.g. in 28:14,
but it refers to a foreign power in 23:13 and to Israel in 9:16.
1 D. Kidner, ‘Isaiah’, in NBC, p. 639.
81
ISAIAH 8:7-8
Context must decide, and here the natural sequence from verse 4
makes it refer to Samaria.’ Shiloah was Jerusalem’s water-supply,
coming into the city from the Gihon Spring. Gihon was the site of
Davidic coronations (1 Ki. 1:33-34, 45) and the stream could
here stand symbolically for the Davidic monarchy. But it
certainly pointed to Jerusalem as the city of faith for, though its
position made it virtually impregnable, its overland water-supply
made it highly vulnerable (7:3). To live in Jerusalem called for
faith that the Lord knew what he was doing when he chose this
city, that he would stand by the promises he had made concerning
it and its king. All this the northern tribes abandoned when they defected from David (1 Ki. 12), and now they rejoice in Rezin
and the son of Remaliah (on whom see 7:8-9). 7-8. Therefore draws out the consequences. The nemesis of choosing the world is to get the world in full and plenty. They rejected the ‘gently flowing waters’ (6) and chose an earthly king (Rezin); they will get the mighty floodwaters of the River (Euphrates) and the king of Assyria with all his pomp. The imperialist mind is itself a sinful thing (10:5—15) but this does not
mean that it is outside the holy rule of God. The over-running
waters only go where he directs them (8a) and to the extent that
he allows them (8b). Thus Assyria would indeed not stop its advance when it fulfilled promises made to Ahaz to end the
northern threat (2 Ki. 16:7—9) but proceeded against Judah. also. This, and later behaviour (2 Ki. 18:13ff.), gave Assyria a deserved reputation for treachery which Isaiah would not forget
(33:1). Outspread wings could refer to the extending floodwaters,
but is more vivid as a change of metaphor from flood to a huge
bird of prey overshadowing the land. Yet the waters do not cover
the head and drown the victim, the bird of prey looms but does
not kill. The Lord has said, ‘Thus far and no further.’ The final
blow against Judah (6:11—13) lies beyond the Assyrian times and power. Nevertheless it is all part of the tragedy of Immanuel, for
it is his land that is despoiled. The seriousness of Ahaz’ decision
is pressed home. Your land, O Immanuel: ‘land’ with a possessive pronoun and a following vocative is not found elsewhere. Furthermore, the singular possessive is linked with land as a political unit only in the case of kings (Dt. 2:31; 2 Sa. 24:13), Israel or some other personification (Je. 2:15; Ho. 10:1) or the Lord (1 Ki. 8:36; Ezk. 36:5). Immanuel cannot be any ordinary
' Since it is impossible to think of Judah ‘rejoicing’ over Remaliah’s son, those who interpret ‘this people’ as Judah resort to a simple emendation (see RSV), making ‘rejoices’ into ‘melts (with fear)’.

ISAIAH 8:9-10
child. But as a royal heir he is now doomed to inherit only suffering and loss.
iii. The believing, obeying remnant (8:9-22). The fact that
Assyria will not prove to be the end for Judah prompts Isaiah to
ponder the idea of a surviving remnant. In this way this new
section integrates with what the prophet has already said, but it is
of immense importance in its own right. Isaiah’s confrontation
with Ahaz (7:3-9) hinged on the issue of personal faith, and
Isaiah now sees clearly that the only future that matters for Judah
is the survival of individual believers within, and in contrast to,
the professing but merely formal people of God. This is the
theme worked out in this key passage. Isaiah’s son (see 18)
Shear-Jashub, who had been involved by divine command in the
crucial confrontation in 7:3ff., has a name meaning ‘a remnant
shall return’, but is this a prediction of mere survival or does it go
deeper?
9-10. Throughout Isaiah’s ministry Judah was threatened by
superior powers, and in these verses he meditates on the fact that
where the Lord is there is security. We are reminded of Psalm 46
with its refrain ‘The LORD Almighty is with us’. Indeed this
psalm (with Pss. 47; 48) could well derive from Isaiah’s circle at
the time of Sennacherib.'! Some, however, think that the
opposition of the world to the people of God and their king was a
theme in temple worship (e.g. Ps. 2), even an annual ritual drama’
in which the king played a central role, was assaulted and
humbled before the forces of the world, and gloriously delivered
by divine intervention — the joy that comes with morning in
Psalm 30:5. At all events, says Isaiah, there is a vital distinction
between this single people on the one hand and even the massed
forces of nations and distant lands on the other: God is with us
(Heb. ‘Immanuel’). Isaiah could not have used this way of
expressing the divine presence if he had not intended a reference
to the virgin’s son of 7:14 and the royal possessor of Judah of
8:8. Immanuel is thus also the ruler of the nations (Pss. 2:7-9;
72:8; 89:27; Dn. 7:13-14) and his presence with one particular
people is the guarantee of their continuance. Be shattered: in
Hebrew a second imperative often expresses the inevitable
consequence of the first — an outcome so unavoidable that it can

ISAIAH 8:11—14a
be commanded to happen. Nothing therefore is more certain than
that the world, choosing to assault Immanuel’s people, is
choosing its own destruction (54:15—-17), no matter how great the
collective strength (9) or how brilliant the planning (10)! (Cf Jn.
16:33.) The themes of international collapse (9) and fruitless
consultation (10) reappear in the fruitless consultation of verses
19-20 and the national collapse of verses 21-22, forming an
inclusio. 11-12. But there is another contrast besides that between
God’s people and the world. The personal word of verse 11 is followed by plural imperatives in verse 12. Isaiah and those associated with him are marked off from these people (12). First,
they are to live under the word of the Lord (11). Hand symbolizes personal agency and power. To say that the LORD
spoke ‘with strength of hand’ (lit.) means with a compelling sense
of a divine word to obey. The separation of prophet and group is not a self-appointed exclusivism but (as is all true separation) obedience to the Lord’s word. It is obedience that is to distinguish them from the way (lifestyle, or characteristic modes
of thought and conduct) of this people. The second difference
(12ab) is their unwillingness to follow popular thinking regarding
some conspiracy. It is possible that Isaiah’s action in opposing
the king’s policy of alliance with Assyria was considered treason
by the royal court and that a rumour was spread to this effect in order to bring him into popular disrepute. If this were the case,
then do not call conspiracy everything that these people call
conspiracy is a command to keep a clear conscience (1 Pet. 3:15—
16). The word, however, could be translated ‘alliance’, in which
case the reference is to the alliance Ahaz thought he was negotiating with Assyria. To Isaiah this was no ‘alliance’ but
submission, trading sovereignty and independence for spurious promises of safety. But Isaiah must rather continue in fidelity to
the Lord’s word as it called to faith rather than to worldly armed
strength. Thirdly, the distinctiveness of the group is seen in their ‘unanxious’ facing of life. All around them there was fear (see
7:2), but in their hearts and in their fellowship there was to be an oasis of calm.
13-14a. Where does this distinctive life find its strength and security? In a life with God (13) and in a life in God (14a). Surrounded by fearful people, Isaiah and his group are not without fear, but their fear and dread (the same words as in 12) are differently directed — towards the LORD (Yahweh, the God of the exodus) Almighty to save his people and to overthrow his enemies (Ex. 14:30-31), awesome in holiness (Ex. 3:5; 19:20—
84
ISAIAH 8:14b-18
22; 20:18-21). Isaiah is to discover the fear of the Lord not in some new manifestation of his power and holiness but in the
basic, once-for-all exodus revelation that the Lord had given of
himself when he redeemed his people (1 Pet. 1:17-21). Regard as
holy: to act towards him as his holiness warrants. Sanctuary is
not a place of asylum but (migdas) a place where God dwells in
his holiness, the word used of the Tabernacle (Ex. 25:8; cf
29:43-46) and the Temple (1 Ch. 22:19), where the Lord himself
came to live among his people and which, in consideration of
their holy Occupant, were houses of sacrifice, offering sinners
access to God and safety in his presence through shed blood. But
the promise now is of a purely spiritual presence: the Immanuelpresence with the true, believing remnant.
14b-15. To others the Immanuel-presence spells doom. Stone
... Stumble ... rock ... fall are literally ‘stone of tripping ... rock
of stumbling’, i.e. careless of God, people ‘trip’ over him to
destruction; frap ... snare express the watchfulness of the Holy
God whereby each receives the destruction due. The rope
stretched across the path, and the rock barring the way, should
have warned them to proceed with caution but, ignoring and
careless, they stumbled and fell. The same God in his unchanging
nature is both sanctuary and snare. It depends on how people
react to his holiness.
Verses 16—22 review again the contrasting groups described in
verses 12—14a and 14b~—15. Isaiah and his group are guardians of
the Lord’s Jaw, deposited among them (16) for them to consult
(19-20), practitioners of patient faith (17) and signs in Israel
pointing to the right way (18). By contrast, those who refuse the
word (20) forfeit the possibility of a fulfilled life (21a), alienate
themselves from God (21b) and find nothing but darkness (22).
The heart of the contrast is J will wait for the LORD (17), they ...
will curse ... their God (21).
16-18. In the structure of the passage these verses match verse
11, the believing remnant under the word of the Lord (11),
gathered round the word of the Lord (16). Bind up (16) means to
‘wrap up’ so as to safeguard from tampering; seal means to attest
as final and therefore to guard from addition. Testimony: what
God has ‘testified to’ as his truth. Law: see 1:10. My disciples:
‘my instructed ones’, i.e. instructed in the word the Lord speaks
(50:4; 54:13). My can refer to either Isaiah or the Lord, but better
the latter as the Lord claims the believing, trusting remnant as his
own. The pronoun / (17) reflects the voice of each individual
disciple, not just of Isaiah. Just as learning from the word (16) is
a disciple’s hallmark, so is patient faith. Wait (qawa, 40:31)
85
ISAIAH 8:19-20
combines patient waiting with confident expecting. Hiding: faith
is made for the dark day. To ‘hide the face’ is a sign of disfavour
(contrast, to make the face shine, see Nu. 6:25). Ahaz alienated
the favour of the Lord, and Isaiah and his group were not immune
from the ensuing darkness, but within that darkness they had the
light of ‘waiting for the Lord’ (Rom. 8:25; 1 Thes. 1:3b). Here
am I: literally ‘Behold’, commanding attention. Isaiah now
speaks for himself. He has had personal dealings with the Lord
and they are part of his confidence as the darkness gathers. Signs
(6t6t) direct attention (Ex. 3:12); symbols, literally ‘portents’ (mop*tim), arrest attention (Ex. 3:3). The coincidence of the birth
of Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz with the ‘great tablet? (1-4) was a
portent; the names of Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz and his brother
were signs. Isaiah’s own name (‘Yahweh saves’) was also a sign.
Who dwells on Mount Zion: the Lord never goes back on his promises. He chose Zion for his dwelling, and this gives Isaiah an objective assurance of faith, just as his and his sons’ names offer
a subjective assurance. 19. Warned against popular fears (12), the group is now
warned against popular superstitions. They will be under pressure
to conform (19a), but there is an issue of loyalty to be considered
(their God) as well as the sheer absurdity of much that people
will do and rely on (dead ... living). Mediums (?6b6t): like the
witch at Endor (1 Sa. 28), who had an ’65 by which she consulted
the dead. Spiritists (yidd*‘onim from Vydda‘, ‘to know’): people
who claimed ‘insider knowledge’, especially of the future (Lv.
19:31; 20:2; Dt. 18:11). Whisper (Nsapap): to squeak (with alarm) (10:14; 29:4; 38:14). Mutter: Vhaga, here, as 38:14, ‘to
moan’. Both verbs mock the antics of the mediums and expose
the absurdity of turning from the plain word of the Lord to
mumbo-jumbo. The sad declension from ‘my people’ (3:12) to
‘this people’ (6:9; 8:12) is brought to a point here in their enthusiasm for fortune-tellers and messages from the dead. Why
consult ...? is just a biting exclamation, ‘On behalf of the living,
to the dead!’ It is commonly claimed that the dead are in possession of greater powers and superior knowledge to the living. In the Bible it is not so. The Old Testament knows that, leaving their bodies behind, the dead can be only shadows of what they were (Is. 14:10); the dead Samuel knows no more after death than he proclaimed when alive (1 Sa. 28:16ff.). See on 19:9. 20. Another telling exclamation. The Jaw and testimony (see 16) are all a disciple needs. Not ... according to this word ... no ... dawn: NIV catches the gist of a difficult piece of Hebrew. There is no hope outside of what the Lord has spoken; every
86
ISAIAH 8:21-22
utterance, however spirit-authorized, which fails to accord with
his word is darkness without light.
21-22. Enduring privation they go into exile (roam through
...), exasperated with their lot politically (king) and spiritually
(God). They are left without hope from God, from earth or from
the future (utter darkness). All these verbs are singular.
Judgment, like salvation, is individual and personal.
iv. The royal hope (9:1—7). Isaiah now reaches the fourth and
final section of his prophecies about Judah. It follows in sequence
from what has gone before. Waiting in faith and hope (8:17), the
remnant is sustained by the forecast of the great light that shines
beyond the darkness. It is a sure hope — so sure that, according to
Hebrew idiom, it is even written in past tenses as though it had
happened already. Because of this confidence Isaiah can place the
light of 9:1 ff. in immediate proximity to the darkness of 8:22, not
because it will immediately happen, but because it is immediately
evident to the eye of faith. Believers walking in darkness can
already see the great light and are sustained by hope. The passage
includes a prose introduction (9:1), which acts as a bridge
between the darkness of 8:21—22 and the dawning of the great
light in the poem of 9:2-7, but this has been done so skilfully that
prose and poetry are now thematically one statement in two parts:
the hope described (1-3) and the hope explained (4—7). Each part
covers the same three internal topics in the same order.
1. What the Lord does: a new situation by act of God. He who
humbled will yet honour. The northern lands of Zebulun and
Naphtali, covering the area west and south-west of the Sea of
Galilee (Jos. 19:10-16, 32-39), were the first part of the
promised land to fall to Assyria (733 BC). Gloom (mii‘ap)
matches ‘gloom’ (md‘ip) in 8:22, and distress (miusaq) reflects
the word translated ‘fearful’ (siiga). Isaiah, therefore, saw his
prediction of darkness begin to be fulfilled but, as always, we
have to decide what reading of our experiences we are going to
live by. The darkness and distress are real but they are neither the
only reality nor the fundamental reality. In any given situation we
can either sink into despair or rise to faith and hope. Isaiah insists
that hope is part of the constitution of the here and now. Galilee
of the Gentiles or ‘nations’ (cf. Jos. 20:7; 21:32; 1 Ki. 9:11; 2 Ki.
15:29; 1 Ch. 6:76) was the northward extension of Naphtali. Noone else but Isaiah ever called this area ‘Galilee of the Gentiles’.
Undoubtedly there was a continuing Gentile component in this
area (see Jdg. 1:30, 33; Ki. 9:11) and maybe this prompted Isaiah
to broaden the vision. It would seem that he could not embark on
87
ISAIAH 9:2-4
his first major statement of the hope of the coming King without
the worldwide dimension hinted here and developed further in
verse 7 and 11:1—16.
2. What the Lord’s people enjoy: darkness become light.
Walking: living out their lives. Darkness: the hiding of the Lord’s
face, during which they persevered in believing expectancy
(8:17). Shadow of death: the noun salmit (‘darkness’) developed
the extended poetic form used here, salmawet (‘death-shadow’).
It means such trouble as casts a death-like shadow. The idea of
death is in the background in an illustrative way; nevertheless it
is a very strong word for life’s calamities. Seen ... light ... light
has dawned: the motif of darkness becoming light points to a
creative act of God. Those who have waited through the darkness
will come to the objective reality of dawn and the subjective
experience of seeing the light.
3. What follows: the Lord increases joy and his people rejoice
before him. Like the New Testament, Isaiah holds in tension the
forecast of a (mere) remnant and the multitude of the redeemed:
1:9; 3:25 — 4:1; 7:3 with 10:20-22; 26:15; 49:19-21; 54:1-3;
66:8-9; Mt. 7:13-14; Lk. 13:23-30; Heb. 2:10; Rev. 7:9.' Before
you: ‘in your presence’. There is a spiritual dimension of restoration and reconciliation, acceptance before God. The old feasts
were in this regard anticipations of the messianic day (Dt. 12:5—
7). Harvest ... plunder: both harvest and victory are divine gifts
(Dt. 28:2-8). Harvest belongs in the sphere of creation; plunder
in the sphere of history. The contrasting spheres express ‘every
sort of joy ever known’.
4. What the Lord does: his act of deliverance. This is the first
explanation of the hope just described. Isaiah looks back to Egypt
and the exodus: yoke (Lv. 26:13), burdens (Ex. 1:11; 2:11; 5:445;
6:6-7), shoulders (Ps. 81:6) and oppressor (Ex. 3:7; 5:6, 10-14).
This was the foundational act of God in redemption, the
fulfilment of the covenant promise to ‘take you as my people and
be your God’ (Ex. 6:6-7). He couples this with Gideon and the
defeat of Midian (Jdg. 6 — 8), a victory wrought through an
insignificant agent (Jdg. 6:15) and in such a way that it could
only be a work of God (Jdg. 7:2-14) but involving and benefiting Naphtali and Zebulun (Jdg. 6:35). The yoke is suffering endured;
! This is one of fifteen occasions where MT notes that the negative particle Jo’ stands for the preposition ‘to him’, /6. Hence the difference between AV and subsequent Eng. versions. There seems no way to make sense of a negative in this verse, and the MT is plainly right to offer ‘You have multiplied the nation; to it you have magnified the joy’.
88
ISAIAH 9:5—7
the rod is suffering inflicted. The contrast expresses totality: all suffering is now at an end in this expected work of God.
5. What the Lord’s people enjoy: the fruits of victory. This is
the second explanation (the word ‘For’ must be reinstated at the
beginning of this verse). The burning of the military hardware
recalls 2:24. The people enter into the fruits of a victory they did
not win: it was the Lord (4) who acted.
6-7. What follows: the King and his rule. Each preceding
explanation leads into this third and fundamental explanation.
How does the victorious, covenant-fulfilling work of God (4)
come about? By what way do the Lord’s people (5) enter a noncontributory salvation? By the mere fact of the King’s birth. The
emphasis rests not on fo us but on a child is born. Child: his
human descent. Son: his maleness and dignity in the royal line.
Born of human parentage but also given by the Lord. His
people’s shoulders (4) are delivered when his shoulders accept
the burden of rule. He will be called: literally ‘one will call his
name’. In its highest use, ‘name’ sums up character; it declares
the person. The perfection of this King is seen in his qualification
for ruling (Wonderful Counsellor),' his person and power (Mighty
God), his relationship to his subjects (Everlasting Father) and the
society his rule creates (Prince of Peace). Wonderful: literally ‘a
Wonder of a Counsellor’. The vast majority of the eighty times
the verb pala’, its noun (as here, pele’) and adjective (pil*’i)
occur, they refer to the Lord, himself and his works. It is the
nearest word Hebrew has to the idea of ‘supernatural’, here
bringing a wisdom far above the human: the fulfilment of 1:26,
contrasting with Ahaz whose decisions ruined his people; like,
but transcending, Solomon whose wisdom remained earthly (1
Ki. 4:29-34). Mighty God: the repetition of this title in 10:21,
referring to the Lord himself, establishes its meaning here.
Translations like ‘Godlike Hero’ are linguistically improbable,
side-stepping the implication that the Old Testament looked
forward to a divine Messiah (see on 4:2; 53:1). Everlasting is
both general (26:4) and specific (57:15). When people requested
a king (1 Sa. 8) they wished to replace the episodic rule of the
Judges with the permanency of monarchy. The King to come is the ultimate fulfilment of this longing. Father: used of the Lord,
1 The older preference (see AV) of according the coming King a fivefold name
is linguistically possible. The Heb. word ‘wonderful’ (pele’ ) does not admit of a
special form to indicate that it is linked with the following genitive. Therefore it
could stand on its own: ‘Wonderful, Counsellor ... ’ The remaining nouns, however, are linked pairs, and this suggests that we should understand the first
component to be ‘a Wonder of a Counsellor’.
89
ISAIAH 9:8 — 11:16
‘father’ speaks of his concern (Ps. 65:5), care and discipline (Ps.
103:13; be 3:12; Is. 63:16; 64:8); cf Ps. 72:4, 12-14; Is. 11:4.
Peace is personal fulfilment (2 Ki. 22:20), well-being (Gn. 29:6),
harmony (Ex. 4:18), peace with God (Nu. 6:26; 25:12; Is. 53:5).
The verb, salém, means ‘to be whole, complete’. Prince
corresponds to our idea of ‘administrator’. This Prince, then,
himself a whole personality, at one with God and with his people,
administers the benefits of peace/wholeness in his benign rule.
This rule, however, will be unchanging in its character (and peace), without end in space and time (for ever), the fulfilment of
the Davidic ideal (Davids, Pss. 2:8; 72:8-11), reflecting the holiness of God in its devotion to justice in practice and righteousness in principle (cf. 5:16), and guaranteed by the commitment (zeal) and activity (accomplish) of the LORD. Zeal:
as passionate commitment (37:32; 42:13; 59:17; 63:15); cf the
love that tolerates no disloyalty and brooks no rival (Nu. 15:11;
Ps. 79:5). It is the Lord who plans the future (1), shatters the foe
(5) and keeps his promises (7).
c. Darkness and light in Israel (9:8 — 11:16)
The doublet — saying broadly the same thing twice over, from
different viewpoints — is one of the characteristics of Isaiah’s book (cf, e.g., 28 — 29 with 30 — 35; 42:18 — 43:21 with 43:22 —
44:23). In this case, 9:8 — 11:16 runs in parallel with 7:1 — 9:7
(see pp. 66-68). The prophets recognized the sad fact of the
divided kingdoms of Judah and Israel (1 Ki. 12) but never —
accepted it. Elijah, for example, in his counterattack on the
apostasy of the northern kingdom under Ahab and Jezebel, took
pains to build his altar on Carmel of twelve stones, naming each
stone for one of the ‘tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the
word of the LORD had come’ (1 Ki. 18:31). Likewise Amos, a
prophet to the northern kingdom, spoke in the name of the Lord
who ‘roars from Zion’ (1:2), included Judah in his condemnation
of the nations (2:4—5), and held out the great hope of a Davidic
restoration (9:11—15). It is the same with Isaiah, the southerner. He accepts the fact of separate kingdoms, he knows that Judah will survive after Israel has been swallowed up by the great powers, but he sees their histories as running along parallel courses — their rejection of the Lord’s word, inevitable judgment and the preserved remnant — culminating in the universal and endless reign of the same glorious King. The divided kingdoms of human sinfulness will become the one kingdom of our God and of his Messiah and he will reign for ever. He has traced out this course for Judah in 7:1 — 9:7. Now it is Israel’s turn. The
90
ISAIAH 9:8—12
Lord’s people sinfully corrupt his purposes but he never alters
course or allows his promises to be rewritten (Nu. 23:19); all who
are ‘written unto life’ (lit., 4:3) will be brought home to Zion
through the same divine management of history and the same promised King.
Isaiah’s doublets, however, are never mere reiterations. The
-second element in the doublet always develops the first. In the
coming section we learn that Assyria will suffer an incurable wound (10:12, 16-19, 27-34); the coming King, dated broadly
‘in the future’ (9:1), now lies beyond the deportation of Judah
foreseen in 6:9-13, but there will be a regathering of the two
halves of the sundered kingdom under him, with the old rivalry
gone (11:12ff.). The thought inherent in the mysterious ‘Galilee
of the Gentiles’ (9:1) becomes the messianic banner of 11:10.
i. The moment of decision (9:8 — 10:4). For the Lord’s
people everything depends on their reaction to his word. The
obedience—blessing—disobedience-cursing syndrome is inherent
in the covenant (Lv. 26:3-13, 14-41). When the word came to
Jacob (9:8) and they chose rather the way of self-sufficiency
(9:9-10), everything else followed as night follows day. In a fourstanza poem of classic biblical social analysis, Isaiah traces out
the terrifying consequences of abandoning revealed truth. The
four stanzas are marked off by a refrain (9:12, 17, 21; 10:4), and
the occurrence of the same words in 5:25 is rightly interpreted as
indicating that some of the material in chapter 5 began life as part
of this poem but, with that proper freedom with which he builds
pre-existing material into a new mosaic, Isaiah used part of the
poem as a climax to chapter 5 and provided 10:5—-15 as a new
climax for the remainder. There are many suggestions regarding
the original shape of the poem, none of which can claim certainty, but a very coherent piece of literature is achieved by
making 5:22-25 the fifth stanza of the poem, with 5:27-30 as its
original conclusion. What we must not do, of course, is reassemble the poem, for this would upset the careful structuring
Isaiah has achieved by using it in two different places, each part
fitting perfectly into its new context.
Stanza 1: National disaster (9:8—12). The Lord’s word has
been rejected in favour of a do-it-yourself reconstruction, but the
internal collapse of Israel (10) will be followed by external attack
(11). When the vineyard produces stink-fruit, the wild beasts
come in (5:4-5). No society can recover save by returning to the
word of the Lord and, as the Bible insists, large-scale consequences follow from spiritual causes,
o1
ISAIAH 9:8-13
8. The message came through the ministries of Amos and
Hosea from 760 BC onwards. Message (‘a word’) is emphatic:
this is the issue, God had spoken: will his people live by
revelation or not? Jt will fall, i.e. what the word foretold will
happen.
0-10. Ephraim, the most prominent tribal constituent of the
Northern Kingdom, is used as a name for the whole. As Genesis
48:5, 13-20 records, the primacy of Ephraim was not by birth but
by grace. The use of the name here, therefore, is deliberate: those
who owed their status to grace were turning to works and self- salvation. Pride (Vga’d, ‘to be high’), a sense of personal superiority to all challenges; arrogance (Vgadeél, ‘to be great’),
sufficiency for all needs. Be 11-12. Jeroboam II (782-753 BC) gave the nation prosperity,
restoring the kingdom to Solomonic boundaries (2 Ki. 14:25), but
what went up like a rocket came down like a stick and in no time
Israel reeled under blow after blow. Its internal collapse (2 Ki.
15, 17) was seen in that six kings reigned during the final twenty
years, four reigns ended in assassination and only one king
passed the throne to his son. So much for replacing fig-trees with
cedars! Externally, Rezin was king of Aram and his foes were the
Assyrians who, from the accession of Tiglath-Pileser in 745 BC,
bent their imperialist ambitions westward. Threatened by
Assyria, Rezin sought a defensive alliance with Israel (see 7:1ff.;
Introduction, pp. 19-20) and Israel complied, but thus choosing
to be like any other worldly power they paid the price by becoming what they chose, a nation caught up in the world’s power
struggle. But behind it all was the empowering (strengthened)
and directing (spurred) sovereign purpose of the Lord (see 10:5—
15). Arameans ... devoured is an ironic comment on the alliance:
Israel saw itself as cleverly securing an ally; Isaiah saw it being
devoured! Philistines: Amos 1:6 hints at such attacks but we do
not know details. Upraised (‘stretched out’): used often (e.g. Ex.
6:6; Dt. 4:34) of the Lord’s power as Redeemer. But when his
word is refused the Redeemer becomes the Judge.
Stanza 2: Political collapse (9:13-17). Inexorably the conse- quences of rejecting the Lord’s word unfold. Refusal of revealed
truth leads to reliance on human wisdom for national guidance, but their leaders are ‘misleaders’ (16) and moral decay is evident throughout society (17). 13. The people: virtually a title for Judah and Israel, ‘the people par excellence’, the Lord’s people. They alone should have been able to see beyond the human agents of their trouble to him who struck them. This would have led to repentance
92
ISAIAH 9:14-17
(returned, Am. 4:6-11) and ‘seeking’ (sought) of the Lord — not
as looking for something lost but as deliberately making for the
place where he is to be found (Dt. 12:5, 11). The LoRD, Yahweh,
the God of the exodus, the God who redeems his people and
overthrows his (and their) foes in his Almighty (‘of hosts’, 1:9) power would soon have delivered!
Within 14-17 the metaphor of verse 14 is explained in 15-17:
verses 15—16, the downfall of leadership and the reason for it; 17,
the ruin of the people and the reason for it.
14. So the LorD: divine sovereignty in executive management
of history, visiting appropriate judgment on sin. Head and tail ...
branch and reed are contrasts expressing totality: head and tail,
i.e. from one end to the other; branch and reed, tall growth and
low growth, i.e. from top to bottom. Single day: possibly the fall
of Samaria in 722 BC or the death of Jeroboam II which marked
the end of stable government; in any case, that decisive moment when the Lord decreed that his people had reached the point of
no return in their refusal of his word.
15. It is characteristic of Isaiah to explain his metaphors (e.g.
8:7). Prominent: ‘uplifted of face’, people who are important
without holding official position. 7ail: a sly ‘dig’ from Isaiah!
The prophets considered themselves spiritual leaders but in fact
they were like tails wagging at popular demand (30:9-11; 1 Ki.
22:6; Mi. 2:11).
16-17. Therefore: both leaders and led (16) are blameworthy
and will reap their reward. The former need not have misled for
the word of the Lord was available; the latter need not have
followed for God’s truth was openly declared to them (Am.
7:10). Young men ... widows: in military overthrow it is the
young adults who pay the price and orphans and widows are left
desolate. The Lord who could be expected to delight in (lit.) ‘his
young men’, and who is famously concerned for the defenceless
(Ps. 68:5), is also the holy God who cannot abide ungodliness,
wickedness and vileness. The Lord is not capricious; behind his
lies his just appraisal of what the situation demands (Gn.
18:20-21). Ungodly (hanép): apostasy alienating God, defilement
by disobedience (Je. 3:1), religious terror (Ps. 106:38). Wicked:
‘evil-doing’, violation of God’s moral law. Vileness (n“bald):
insensitivity to moral and spiritual realities and obligations (1 Sa.
25:25; 2 Sa. 13:12-13). The three words together express that
practical atheism which believes life can be lived without God,
that he and his word are irrelevancies in the ‘real’ world.
Stanza 3: Social anarchy (9:18—21). The failure of leadership
(13-17) leads to unchecked self-seeking, sweeping like forest fire
93
ISAIAH 9:18 — 10:3
through the land (18). Each is now out solely for himself (19cd)
yet without satisfaction (20a-d). Relationships, whether of the
nuclear (20ef) or the extended (21) family, no longer signify.
‘Postmodern’ individualism is as old as Isaiah: its opportunity
lies in a day of social collapse; its root in rejection of the word of
the Lord.
18. Life astray from God is inherently destructive (burns),
carries all before it — both the expendable (briers) and the useful
(forest) — and pollutes the very air we breathe (smoke).
Everything ‘goes up in smoke’. 19-21. It does so by the will of God expressing itself in wrath.
The same fire of wrath produces unrestrained individual selfassertion: neither general brotherliness (19d), nor parental feeling
(20e), nor tribal relationship within the same nation (21ab) raises
barriers to dominant self-assertion. The only thing that unites is
common enmity against another brother within the same family
(21c). How perceptive the prophet is: with all this evident
domestic and social need crying out for remedy, there is still
energy and resource to go to war! And yet no-one is satisfied
(20a—d). The ‘grab-all’ society is a hungry place to live.
Stanza 4: Blatant misrule (10:1—4). In this, the final stanza of
the poem as it now stands, the social unruliness and self-seeking
of verses 13-21 issues in the dominance of an unscrupulous
clique making laws for their own ends. If people refuse the rule
of the word of God, they end up under unprincipled human rule.
1-2. Unjust ('dwen) is basically ‘trouble, mischief’ and then
the trouble which idolatry or sin brings. Oppressive translates
‘amal, which never means ‘oppression’ but ‘grievousness’ (e.g.
Gn. 41:51; Jdg. 10:16). Such is this government that each next
enactment means only more grief for the ruled. Their particular
targets are the poor and the oppressed and their object is prey and
robbing, self-enrichment. All this is the very contradiction of the
Lord’s ways and concerns: he identified with the poor and the
oppressed in his exodus deliverance; he cares for the fatherless
and the widow (Dt. 10:18; 26:5—7; Pss. 10:14; 68:5; 146:9; cf
Ex. 22:22); but when his people reject his word and its values, his wrath (9:19) consigns them to the opposite, to the values prompted by fallen human nature.
3. Reckoning: from Vpdqad, ‘to review, make reckoning’, specifically of the Lord’s day of reckoning. From afar: cf. 5:26, a concealed reference to Assyrian invasion. The now all- commanding rulers will then have neither future (Jo whom ... run?) nor past (where ... leave?). Riches (or ‘glory’): i.e. not just cash but also self-importance, pride of person and position.
94
ISAIAH 10:4-6
4. How very far from the future that the leaders had in mind! Fall is the last word of the line and recalls the same verb in 9:8. :
To refuse the revealed word may well seem an irrelevance in the
‘real world’ of construction programmes (9:10), political
manoeuvrings and superpower posturings (9:10), of prominent
civil and church leaders (9:15), or average human wickedness
(9:18) and governmental mismanagement, but in the long run it is
the word which ‘falls’ (9:8) and those who have rejected it fall
among the slain.
ii. Divine judgment (10:5-15). This brief passage, dealing
though it does with a single historical event (the Assyrian
invasions from 734 to 701 BC), is one of the Bible’s profoundest
statements on the nature of earthly history, the relation between
the King and the kings. It corresponds to the Assyrian passage in
7:18 — 8:8. The passages coincide in affirming divine control over
history (7:18; 10:6) but, while the former concentrates on the fact
and effects of the Assyrian incursion, this passage asserts a
philosophy of history, how the historical facts arise from hidden
supernatural causes, and how the human actors who are the
hinges on which history outwardly turns are themselves personal
and responsible agents within a sovereignly ordered and exactly
tuned moral system. From the literary point of view these eleven
verses are a carefully crafted poem and a good place to appreciate
Isaiah’s skill as a wordsmith.
5 (Al; corresponding to A2 in 15). Two inanimate objects, rod
and club, teach that the Assyrian — the then superpower — has no
ability except what the Lord gives (Jn. 19:11). He is an
instrument in the Lord’s hands. Anger ... wrath are respectively
felt anger and expressed anger and these are the driving forces
behind the Assyrian. Woe: better (here) ‘Ho!’, a word of
summons (cf 7:18) rather than condemnation.
6 (B1) describes the Lord’s motive. Send ... dispatch continue
the note of divine initiative and authority behind the Assyrian
incursion and contribute to the insistence on the executive,
directive sovereignty of God in world affairs, which is central to
the whole passage. The first verb is intensive in form and denotes
the directive of a superior to an underling; the second (lit.) ‘give
him a command’, i.e. ‘brief him for the task’. Behind the mission
is a divine moral purpose: godless (hanép), see 9:17; who anger
me, justly meriting my (overflowing) anger. Seize ... plunder:
these words contain the components of Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz,
8:14, and indicate the fulfilment of the word that was ‘made
flesh’ in Isaiah’s second son (cf 55:11).
oS
ISAIAH 10:7-14
Verses 7-11 (C1) describe Assyria’s motive. ae
7. The Lord intends a morally punitive expedition, but the
Assyrian intends an extension of his own imperialism and the end
of the national sovereignty of others.
8-9. The Assyrian has confidence based on his resources (8)
and accomplishments (9). Already nations have become his
vassals and their kings his commanders. In the paired towns, the
first in each pair is further south than the second. Thus, from Carchemish on the Euphrates in the far north of Palestine to
Calno, and from Arpad fifty miles to the south to Hamath a
hundred miles north of Damascus, and on to Damascus itself and
then to Samaria, his armies have proved invincible. Isaiah is a
master of this sort of impressionistic picture of events (cf 28—
32), making us feel the surge and sweep of the advancing march:
cf. the ‘tide’ picture in 8:6-8. 10-11. What price Jerusalem then? With heavy irony, Isaiah
‘overhears’ the king of Assyria envisaging Samaria and then
Jerusalem as even more helpless before him because, after all,
they are not quite so proficient in their idolatry! But the reality is
there in the balanced words idols ... images ... images ... idols: it
was not armaments that rendered them helpless before Assyria
but spiritual falsity. Idols (’‘lilim): the ‘no-gods’ of 2:8, the
worthless nonentities.
12 (B2). It is probably right that NIV prints this verse as prose.
We should look upon it as showing the careful way Isaiah edited _
his material so as to adapt it from whatever was its original shape
to fit its new situation in the total presentation of his message.
The way that B2 matches B1 indicates this. The Lord, who had a
purpose in mind in making Assyria the rod of his anger (5), now
assesses if the Assyrian has matched this purpose and finds him
wanting. All the arrogant power of verses 7—11 is wholly subject
to a supreme power. Finished: a tailoring or weaving term, to
‘snip off’ a thread when the sewing is finished. Wilful pride ...
haughty look: literally ‘the fruit of the arrogance of heart and the
vainglory of the haughtiness of his eyes’. The ‘heart’ is what he is inwardly, the ‘eye’ is the organ of ambition, desire and objective — what he ‘has an eye to’/‘has his eye on’. What he did conformed to the will of God; why he did it had nothing to do with that will but only with his own vaingloriousness. 13-14 (C2) is Assyria’s assessment of the situation. The king boasts of his abilities (13ab), achievements (13cde) and irresistible power (14), changing structures (boundaries), dis- regarding rights (plundered their treasures) and deposing rulers (kings). Strength (kdah): not ‘resources’ but ‘ability’. Hand, the
96
ISAIAH 10:15
organ of personal action; wisdom, the organizing mind behind it. Together they register the claim ‘all my own work’. Understanding (bin): discernment to see to the heart of a matter. Mighty
one (’abbir) is used of the Lord in 1:24, and here is certainly a
quasi-divine claim: ‘God-like, I subdued’ — and it was all as easy
as bird-nesting!
We can now look back briefly over the ground covered so far:
the Lord had a work to do at Jerusalem and he chose to use the
Assyrian to do it. Furthermore, the work was done as exactly as
when a master-tailor snips off his final thread. But there the
identity between Sovereign and agent ended. The Lord had a holy
purpose to fulfil, expressing his moral outrage — anger and wrath
against godlessness (5-6); the Assyrian had a sinful purpose to
fulfil: to manifest invincible military power, to assert an immoral
right to rule the world, to give free rein to vainglory, arrogance
and self-importance. The deed was just, the doing was morally outrageous.
15 (A2). The same two tools, rod ... club, and in the same
order as verse 5, form a perfect inclusio, but now the message is
driven home by two further inanimate objects, axe ... saw. The
verse matches the ‘hand and mind’ claim of the king (13). In the
relation between man and tool, where is the organizing mind
(15a)? Where is the strength of hand (15b)? Raise itself ... boast
are related respectively to the wilful pride ... haughty heart of
verse 12. The king is a hollow man! He would have no power
except it had been given him from above (Jn. 19:11). Isaiah offers
a comment on his view of history and the relation between
earthly power and sovereign power in the implied illustration of
horse and rider in 37:29. In that relationship all the brute energy
resides in the horse; all the direction, control and management is
in the rider. They are one in enterprise but distinct in function.
The powers of earth fashion their policies, priorities and
activities; the divine Rider appoints holy objectives, accomplishes holy judgments and visits holy retributions.
iii. The believing, obeying remnant (10:16-34). As in the
parallel 8:9-22, within the Lord’s just judgments there is a preservative at work, for the Lord never deserts his people nor
allows them to come to an end, no matter how great the odds are
against them. As so often in Isaiah, the message is in the structure
as well as in the content. In verses 16—19 (al) divine judgment on
Assyria leaves only a pathetic shadow of the once mighty nation,
but judgment on Israel leaves a truly believing remnant (20-23; bl); thus through the Lord there is security for Zion’s people
v1
ISAIAH 10:16-20
(24-26; b2) but destruction for Assyria (27-34; a2). The two bsections are wrapped around by the a-sections, just as the tiny
Israel is surrounded by the opposing world. Sin never goes
unpunished, but neither does the world manage a final triumph
(Mt. 16:18; Jn. 16:33; 1 Jn. 4:4). The whole section 1s one of
extraordinary vividness, with a telling illustration within each
sub-section: wasting sickness forms an inclusio in 16 and 18, the
irrecoverable decline of Assyria; the innumerable sand reduced to
a remnant (22) conveys the grimly sad failure of Israel to capitalize on the Lord’s promises; the historical incidents of
Gideon (26ab; Jdg. 6 — 9) and the exodus (26cd; Ex. 14)
illustrate, respectively, the Lord’s power on behalf of the tiny few
and the helpless many; and the felling of the forest (33-34)
describes the decisive divine victory over Assyria.
Verses 16-19 pronounce judgment on Assyria. The metaphors
of sickness (16b, 18c) and fire (16c—17) blend internal and
external factors in the downfall of Assyria, the slow maturing of
terminal illness, the totality of destruction by fire.
16. Therefore: a conclusion is drawn from the nature of earthly
history as revealed in verses 5-15. Behind every historical
movement is the Sovereign Lord. For holy purposes he appointed
the rise of Assyria (5-6); in holy judgment he, the Lord, the LORD Almighty — ‘the Sovereign One (’“déndy), Yahweh the
Omnipotent (of hosts)’ — now appoints its decline (disease) and
end (fire).
17. Cf 30:27-33. The Assyrians, marching on Jerusalem, are
walking straight into the fire! Israel is under judgment (6) but its
Light has not gone out; they have offended his holiness but he is
oe BS Holy One, ever on his people’s side. Single day: see
18-19. Forests, uncultivated growth, and fertile fields, planned
tillage, form a contrast expressing totality. Trees: yet another
metaphor (cf 33-34). Following the débacle at Zion (37:36),
Assyria entered a period of slow decline — so diminished that even a child could conduct a census!
Verses 20-23 pronounce judgment on Israel. Though it is the
Lord who leaps to his people’s defence (17), yet it is as the Holy
One that he belongs to Israel (17, 20). The fire that burns for them also burns within them. They cannot escape his searching judgment (cf Am. 3:1—2). 20. Contrasting objects of trust: Israel had sought security in the Aram-Ephraimite alliance against the rising threat of Assyria (see 7:1ff.; Introduction, pp. 19-20), but one they trusted, Aram, had been their national foe throughout the previous century (e.g.
98
ISAIAH 10:21-23
9:12; 2 Ki. 6:8:1, 24-25; 13:3), striking them over and over
again. But the day will come when such folly will be renounced
and there will be a true reliance on the LorD. Isaiah’s experience
had shown him that the God whose holiness condemns (6:3—5) is
the God who forgives and reconciles (6:6-8). He sees that this
will yet work on a national scale. Rely: ‘lean’, a lovely synonym for trusting.
21-23. There are two sides to the Shear-Jashub theme
introduced in 7:4. On the one hand, there is the certain hope of a
preserved remnant (21); on the other hand, the sad contrast (22)
between ‘the few that be saved’ and the innumerable company of
the divine promise (Gn. 22:17). NIV, however, does not offer the
only understanding of verse 22. First, only is an interpretative
addition, assuming that remnant here has a threatening sense.
Secondly, though is not the most obvious translation of the
preposition ki ’im. It is usually a strong adversative, ‘But (contrary to what you might have thought)’. By itself, remnant in
verse 21 would suggest a small number, ‘but, to the contrary’,
your people will be like the sand by the sea: this is the remnant
that will return. In a word, the Lord will stand by his promises to
Abraham and they will be fulfilled. In the light of this, destruction (and the related word in 23) could be translated
‘consummation’: i.e. the Lord will unfailingly bring his promises
to their intended conclusion. The interests of the passage are,
however, best served by preserving NIV (except for restoring the
‘For’ which should introduce 23). The Holy One who will keep
his promises must do so in a way that is true to his holiness.
Therefore, the destruction due to sin cannot be withheld, and it
will come upon the whole land (23).
Mighty God (21) plainly refers to the Lord himself, and there
is no way it could be reduced to ‘Godlike Hero’, as some suggest,
for its earlier appearance (see on 9:6). The reference here to ‘a
transcendent God (’é/) of warrior prowess’ — like the God of
Joshua 5:13 — 6:27, and as Isaiah will see him in 59:15b-20 —
suits this context where his people have been under the
conqueror’s heel.
In verses 24—34, Isaiah focuses on Jerusalem and how it will
fare against the Assyrian threat. The topic is dealt with in an
orderly fashion: verses 24-26, the security of Zion notwithstanding the severity of the threat; verses 27-34, the destruction
of the Assyrian invader. But in all this, however, northern Israel
is not forgotten. Isaiah can offer Israel assurance about the
promises of verses 21-22 only by showing what is going to
happen to the nation which seemed to have killed off the
99
ISAIAH 10:24-25
promises once and for all, for it was at Zion that Assyria received
its death-blow. But if Judah panicked (7:1—3) at the thought of a
threat from Aram and Ephraim, with what trepidation they must
have watched Assyria ‘sweep on into Judah, swirling over it’
(8:8). Thus verses 24-26 show how the Lord will lift that burden
from them but not, however, before they have suffered under the
conqueror’s heel (28-31) and the ultimate disaster has threatened
even the city itself (32). Notice how this passage resonates with
the vocabulary of verses 5-15: rod and club (24; 5, 15), anger
and wrath (25; 5), and axe (34; 15). Words that earlier suggested
that the Lord sided with Assyria are cleverly turned around to
express the opposite view as history’s Sovereign visits merited
punishment on the aggressor. Verses 24-26 also assert Zion’s security. For northern Israel, hope was deferred. The Judge of all
the earth, who always does right (Gn. 18:25), works by a logic
which leaves us baffled, and we have here a good example of its operation. Israel ceased to exist following the fall of Samaria to
the Assyrian in 722 BC, but Judah, notwithstanding the decisive unbelief of Ahaz (7:9), would survive the Assyrian onslaught.
24. This is the astonishing force of therefore. If we were to
draw a conclusion from the destruction theme of verses 22-23,
we would proceed to declare Judah’s fall too. But the Lord’s
‘therefores’ are not the same as ours (55:8), and it is his logic
which decrees that Judah will suffer but not be finished when the
same enemy attacks whose power proved terminal for Israel.
Three grounds of assurance are offered to bolster the command
do not be afraid. First, there is the nature of their God. He is the
Lord (’“donay) the Sovereign (6:1); the LoRD (Yahweh, the God
of the exodus who delivers his people and overthrows their foes)
Almighty (‘of hosts’; see 1:9), the God who is in himself every
potentiality and power. Secondly, there is their standing with him.
They are still my people, still those who live in Zion, the people
of the Davidic covenant with its promises. This latter element is
emphatic: in Zion would have sufficed to make the point; who
live in Zion underlines it. The Lord is on their side (my), his
promises still stand. Thirdly, they have the comfort of history. Assyrian domination is only as Egypt did — and please remember how the Lord dealt with that! 25. The ‘For’ with which this verse should begin introduces it as a further explanation of the command not to fear. The problem is not Assyrian displeasure but my anger ... wrath (see 10:5). The anger he feels is passing; the wrath he expresses will lead to Assyrian destruction — and all this very soon. True faith is imminent expectation.
100
ISAIAH 10:26-32
26. Two historical illustrations confirm the two sides of the message of verse 25. The Gideon incident (Jdg. 7:25) recalls the Lord’s destruction of his people’s foes, raising his staff (Ex.
14:16) recalls his deliverance of his people. Whip occurs in Isaiah
only at 28:15, 18, where Assyria is the ‘scourge’ of Judah.
Ironically, those who take the whip perish by the whip!
In verses 27-34, the picture of the yoked beast (Judah, 27) and
the contrasting picture of the felled forest (Assyria, 33-34)
provide brackets around the triumphalist progress of self-assured
invaders towards their objective (Jerusalem, 28-32). With the
removal of the yoke (27) Judah is free; with the felling of the
forest (33-34) Assyria is destroyed.
27. The burden implies ‘under obligation’, the yoke implies
‘under orders’; with both gone, total liberation has been accomplished. Because you have grown so fat interprets the enigmatic
expression ‘because of oil’ and (presumably) would mean that,
since this overweight and unfit beast is no longer serviceable, its
services are dispensed with. This is an odd view of why Judah
was liberated and why Assyria gave up overlordship! ‘Oil’
symbolizes inherent richness or strength. If it alludes to an
inherent, secret strength in Judah, it points to the Davidic
promises (24; cf. 28:16). Assyria’s ‘sturdy warriors’ (16), literally
‘fat, vigorous, strong ones’, uses a related word. They, however,
waste away, while Judah enjoys a preservative ‘fatness, oil’.'
28-32. Isaiah imaginatively sketches the advance of the Assyrian armies. These verses could, of course, be a description
of a foreseen reality, with the prophet taking up the description at
Aiath, probably Ai (Jos. 7:2), fifteen miles north of Jerusalem,
moving south to Migron, possibly an area rather than the place
mentioned in 1 Samuel 14:2 (which is south of Michmash), 300
feet down from the pass (29) at Michmash, where they decide not
to halt but to push on to Geba 500 feet up the other side. At this
point the foe has entered Judah. Jerusalem is but six miles off and
the fortress towns of Ramah and Gibeah (29) fail to stay their
progress. Anathoth, five miles north, with its neighbouring
Gallim and Laishah, fall (30), as do the unknown Madmenah and
1 The end of v. 27 is highly enigmatic. Lit. ‘because of oil’. NIV, because you
have grown so fat, paraphrases the Heb. at the expense of making no sense. The
various emendations suggested by scholars are more numerous than persuasive.
This is the second time the idea of ‘oil/fatness’ has occurred in this context. In v.
16 ‘wasting disease’ destroys Assyria’s ‘fat ones’ (mismannaw). Their inner
resources are not equal to the challenge, but Israel has a secret ‘fatness’ of which
they know nothing. Poetry is inherently allusive, and it is probably along this line
that the truest understanding of this allusion lies.
101
ISAIAH 10:33-34
Gebim (31), and with the Assyrian arrival at Nob (32) -
doubtfully identified as a mile off — Jerusalem is itself under
threat.
The verbs enter ... pass (28) are past tenses, probably
representing reports brought back to headquarters from the front.
Store: better ‘examine, review weapons’, i.e. preparatory to the
final assault. The introduction of quasi-direct speech, We will
camp (29), adds vividness and also reveals the self-confidence of
the enemy. :
Cry out (30) is literally ‘Scream at the top of your voice’;
Daughter ... Poor (‘afflicted’): words are heaped up to conjure
the picture of the arrival of the pitiless Assyrian soldiery, with
females, as ever, the chief sufferers of male wars.
33-34. It may be that these verses were originally the opening
of the poem of the messianic King in 11:1—16 and described how
the Lord would make every preparation for the emergence and
growth of Jesse’s shoot (11:1) — and, of course it still fulfils this
function: since the coming King is pictured in a forestry motif,
the preparation for his coming is a ground-clearing operation. But
Isaiah has now related it chiefly to its foregoing context, as the
outline above shows. The felling of the trees is the destruction of
Assyria right at the very gates of Zion, as it were. A falling of a
great tree is always dramatic; this one all the more so, following
five verses of Assyrian vaingloriousness! Assyria, who was ‘the
axe’ in the Lord’s hand (10:15), now feels an axe (cf. 10:12). The
view of history expressed in 10:5—15 is not wishful thinking but
the sober reality of things, for before the Mighty One is (lit.)
simply ‘by a Mighty One’. The Lord is himself the Agent. Isaiah
Aoath to chapters 36 — 37 the narration of the actual event itself.
iv. The royal hope (11:1—16). For the outline of Isaiah 7 — 11,
see pp. 66-68 above. When the prophet brought the message of
royal hope to Judah, the dawning light of the birth of the King
was seen against the background of the darkness of sin and death
engulfing the people (8:20-22; 9:1-7; of: Lk. 21:25-27); here the
perfect King and his reign over a restored world are consequent
on the destruction of the kings of the earth (cf Ps. 2; Rev. 17:12-
14; 20:7—15). Like the hope expressed in Isaiah 9:1ff., thi
churc
The King in Eden (11:1-10). Bracketed by references to Jesse and roots/Root in verses 1 and 10 (cf, rest in 2, 10), this

also is undated, and therefore an ever-present and living hope not only for those to whom Isaiah ministered but continuin or until he comes faye bile
ISAIAH 11:1-2
passage has four sections: 1-2, the ancestry and endowment of
the King; 3-5, his rule; 6-9, his world; 10, his worldwide significance.
1. Jesse: the expectation is not simply of a coming king but of
a coming David for, though successive kings were assessed by
comparison with ‘their father David’ (e.g. 2 Ki. 18:3), only David
is ‘the son of Jesse’ (e.g. 1 Ki. 12:16). When Jesse produces a
shoot it must be David (cf. Je. 30:9; Ezk. 34:23-24; Ho. 3:5). The
golden king of the past foreshadows the true gold to come. Shoot
(Aoter): ‘young growth’; Branch (néser): ‘sapling’. Neither is the
word used in 4:2, but the metaphorical significance is the same,
here the human ‘family tree’ of the Messiah. Isaiah takes
seriously his prediction in 6:13 — the time will come when all
signs of life in the Davidic monarchy will have disappeared, like
a tree cut to the stump, but there remains a secret vitality. He
knew that the monarchy could not survive the unbelief of Ahaz
(7:9); he foresaw too the ensuing calamity (6:9-12). It would
have been odd indeed if he had not felt the tension between this vision of termination and his other peeceenaat ne Davie glory (1:25-27). Will the Lord then revoke his promises or will
he Keep them? Passages like 9:1—7 and 11:1—16 arise out of this
tension in Isaiah’s message and affirm the faithfulness of God to
his purposes and promises.
2. This sevenfold elaboration of the divine endowment of the
1 The OT has the same general revelation of the Spirit of God as the New:
personal qualities (Is. 63:10; Eph. 4:30), distinctness (Is. 63:11; Mk. 1:9-11),
divine presence (Ps. 139:7; Jn. 14:16-17, 23), indwelling (Is. 63:11; Hg. 2:5; 1
Cor. 3:16; 6:19), etc. See J. A. Motyer, NBCR, pp. 28-29.
2 From the Collect for Whitsunday, The Book of Common Prayer.
103
ISAIAH 11:3-7
Knowledge goes beyond ‘knowing about’. According to 1
Samuel 3:7, the young Samuel, for all his religious involvement
and the ‘knowledge’ it must have brought (1 Sa. 2:11, 18, 21, 26),
‘did not yet know the LoRD’, for knowledge is enjoying a
personal, intimate relationship with a person (Gn. 4:1, RV, RSV).
When that person is the Lord, the relationship demands and
prompts the fear which shows itself in moral concern (Gn.
20:11), obedience (Ex. 20:20), sensitive conduct (Ne. 5:9, 15),
loyalty (Ps. 2:11) and worship (Ps. 5:7). (Cf 2 Cor. 7:1; 1 Pet.
1:17-18; 3:15.) Verses 3-5 reveal the king responding to the Lord (3a, 5) and
exercising his royal office as judge (3b, 4).
3. He will delight: literally ‘his delighting’, ie. his whole
capacity for delight will be absorbed in the Lord. In judgment he
can go beyond the apparent (sees ... hears) to the truth of the
matter (like David, 2 Sa. 14:20). 4. Righteousness ... judge: see on 1:21; 5:16. The king knows
the divine principles of right and can apply them correct
saiemcnis: Hat cathe othes hand. be is alcacaualiaeeta a to
the deservings of people; justice is here misér, ‘uprightness,
straightness, fairness’. Consequently, both the poor and the
wicked are dealt with even-handedly. Neither improper favour to
the needy nor disfavour to the wicked subverts the exact balance of justice. Lips ... mouth: the king needs no other weapon than
his word (Rev. 19:15, 21), because his word is annexed to his
breath, literally ‘spirit’ (as Ps. 33:6).
5. The motif of ‘clothing’ expresses both the inherent qualities
of the wearer and the oses to which the wearer is committed (59:16-17: 61:10; Jos 5.13: Ps, 132:9, 16, 18). Here belt symbolizes ability and readiness for action. Righteousness is
whatever matches and expresses what the Lord thinks is right;
faithfulness is what is unshakeably committed to what the Lord
directs. Respectively they are spiritual integrity and loyalty.
In verses 6-9 the Edenic element in Isaiah’s thought appears
again (cf 2:4). The dawning light of a new world was explained
by the birth of the King in 9:1-7; here the rule of the King produces a new order. 6. Old hostilities and fears are reconciled and allayed. Predators and prey live together: a mere child is safe among them, and also human dominion (Gn. 1:28) no longer takes the form of our often inhumane exploitation of animals, but wears instead this gentle and unthreatening face. 7. Natures are transformed. The point made here is not simply ‘togetherness’ — the message of verse 6 — but identity of nature.
104
ISAIAH 11:8-10
They all eat the same food: carnivores have becomes herbivores.
The reference to their young shows that the transformation is a permanent heredity.
_ 8. The sequence in verse 6 moved from the beasts to the child;
similarly verse 7 moves to 8, but now the relationship of humankind to reptiles is in focus: not the restoration of true ‘dominion’
as in verse 6, but the lifting of the curse of Genesis 3:15. Infant is
the child at the breast Gonégq), utterly helpless in itself; young
child (gamil) is the toddler, capable of running thoughtlessly into
danger. But now there is neither a danger that strikes nor a danger
that lurks. The ‘enmity’ has gone. All that can be said of cobra
(Dt. 32:33; Jb. 20:14) and viper (59:5; Je. 8:17) is that some sort of dangerous reptile is meant.'
9. A summary (9a) and an explanation (9b) of verses 6-8. Cf
the joy in Psalms 96:11-13 and 98:7-9 when the Lord comes to
judge (to make those royal decisions which will set everything to
rights); cf 34:13-17; 65:25. Harm ... destroy: literally ‘act
wrongly ... act corruptly’, neither do what is bad nor mar what is
good. My holy mountain: in 2:2, the Lord’s mountain was the
gathering-point for all the earth; now all the earth is the Lord’s
mountain, wholly conformed to his holiness. The key to this
transformed, renewed creation is the knowledge of the LORD. As
the holy God dwells with them, ungrieved by sin, welcoming
them to his holy place, they on their part enter into personal,
intimate union with him, knowing the Lord (cf verse 2d).
Everywhere the Lord is present in his holiness; everywhere the
knowledge of him is enjoyed, knowing both the truth and the
Lord of truth. 10. See on verse 1 above. The peoples and nations have a
mode of access in that they rally to the Root of Jesse. The
mountain is his rest or ‘home’ (m*nihda; cf. Ru. 1:9) which he
opens to them. But how can one and the same person be both the
shoot coming from Jesse (1) and the Root from which Jesse
comes? This is an enigma unexplained until Luke 1:32. Glorious:
literally ‘glory’. The Messiah is at home in the divine glory and
to this he welco who rally, literally ‘seek’. This does not
mean groping after what is lost, hoping to find it, but coming
with joyous and zealous commitment to where it is known he will
be found (see on 9:13).
The world’s King (11:11-16). The inclusio of this section is
provided by references to the Lord’s hand, Assyria and Egypt in
verses 11 and 15-16. The hand is divine personal action,
1 The word m® iird occurs only here and its meaning is uncertain.
105
ISAIAH 11:11-13
matching the divine zeal of 9:7, an exodus-motif (Ex. 3:19-20;
13:3; Dt. 6:21). In verses 3-5, the King was seen ruling; now the
Lord gathers and transforms the people over whom he will rule
(12-13); the worldwide kingdom to which the Root of Jesse was
the key (6-9, 10) is now realized (14). In this beautifully
structured section, two pairs of verses of divine action (11-12,
15-16) enclose two verses of transformed people (13-14).
11. In that day, here as in verse 10, indicates the
eschatological nature of the vision. A second time: the “first time’
was the exodus. Note how the poem ends on this theme in 16d.
But now there is a wider exodus of a worldwide people. Assyria
... Egypt are the contemporary and ancient great oppressing
powers. No force can hinder the Lord’s purpose. South and
further south lay Upper Egypt (lit. Pathros) and Cush, with Elam
and Babylonia to the east, Hamath in the far north, and the
islands of the sea are the outlying lands to the west (see 40:15)' —
no distance or remoteness around the whole world can prevent
this great exodus. Babylonia is literally Shinar. There is no reason
why Isaiah should have avoided mentioning Babylon. It was a
prominent power of his day. Did he therefore choose to use the
ancient name Shinar, the place of human self-sufficiency (Gn.
11:1—9) and inherent wickedness (Zc. 5:5—11), to indicate that not
even pride and sin can hinder the gathering?
12. Exiles is simply ‘dispersed ones’ (Vnddah; a synonym of
scattered, \piis); the translation exiles is too suggestive of simply
the Babylonian exile. A wider dispersion is indicated by the four
quarters of the earth. Matthew 24:31 is the fulfilment. The Lord’s
threats (scattered, 6:11-12) are as seriously meant as are his promises (gather).
13. Under David, the twelve tribes enjoyed a real if fragile
unity. It was never so before him nor after him. This vision of
reconciliation is part of Isaiah’s forecast of David’s return and the
kingdom that will yet be (Lk. 1:32-33). This verse can be
understood as a balanced statement: the jealousy Ephraim suffers
(13a) and the jealousy Ephraim feels (13c); the enmity Judah
suffers (13b) and the enmity Judah expresses (13d). Emotions
(jealousy) and actions (enmity) of hostility are alike banished from this truly united people.
' The word translated is/ands (iyyim) occurs 38 times in the OT of which 17 are in Isaiah. In chs. 40 — 55 (9 times) it is virtually a technical term for the “Gentile world’ (cf Pss. 72:10; 97:1). As a word, it first means ‘island’ in the Strict sense; then land lying along the sea coast, hence, places accessible only by water; and, finally, land masses, far-flung parts of the earth.
106
ISAIAH 11:14-16
14. The theme of the Davidic kingdom continues. It was David who conquered Philistia (2 Sa. 5:17-25), the east
(probably the mercenaries mentioned in 2 Sa. 10:6), Edom (2 Sa.
8:14), Moab (2 Sa. 8:2-13) and the Ammonites (2 Sa. 10-12).
This picture of warlike conquest by the united people jars against
the vision of the Prince of Peace and the extending kingdom of
peace in 9:6—7, but in fact what we have here is a consistent use
of metaphor, not a forecast of events. It is exactly the same as the
metaphor of the Christian armour (Eph. 6:10ff.). Kings
customarily extend their kingdoms by armed conquest. Within
the picture of the coming King, therefore, Isaiah envisages the
spreading royal dominion: but the force to which the nations
fall is that of the Prince of Peace, the gospel (Acts 15:14ff.).
The reconstituted people of God are the agents in kingdom extension.
15. The prophet now reaches back beyond David to the
exodus. Then the drying up of the sea facilitated the exit of the
people from bondage; here it facilitates entrance, but it is the
same divine wind (Ex. 14:21).' The inclusion of the Euphrates
not only affirms that no obstacle can stand in the Lord’s path but
reintroduces the Assyria-Egypt theme of a universal exodus
begun in verse 11 and concluded in verse 16. The word streams
(n‘halim) means a river bed which is only intermittently filled
with water. Consequently it can be a dry river valley (2 Ki. 3:17),
and that is its most suitable meaning here. The mighty Euphrates
becoming a nahal! What power must be at work! Seven: the
number reflecting the perfect, complete work of God.
16. The work of new creation has been done and the world is
ready for the one people. This coming exodus is as it was for
Israel. We could translate the remnant of his people as ‘his
remnant people’ (see 24:16), the gathering of his elect from the
four comers of the earth (Mk. 13:27). What the New Testament
will yet call ‘the Israel of God’ is thus envisaged by Isaiah as he
foresees the one people brought together by divine action.
I NIV dry up makes a slight alteration to MT and loses its vigour. Lit. ‘utterly
destroy’. Vidram occurs 29 times in Exodus—Joshua. Typically used in Jos. 2:7;
6:17, it refers to things so vile that they must forthwith be ‘separated’ from human
contact, and so wicked that they must immediately be dismissed to the Lord for
his judgment. In the present case it refers to man-made barriers which the
exclusivist and separatist tendencies of human sinfulness have erected. These are
abhorrent to the Lord as contrary to his creative design. In the ‘day’ which Isaiah
foresees here, these (and all other evidences) of sin and curse will disappear. The
word translated scorching is of uncertain meaning.
107
ISAIAH 12:1-2
d. The individual in the community — salvation, singing and
the proclamation (12:1—6)
This song forms the concluding bracket/inclusio to chapters 6 —
12, to which 6:1—13 is the opening bracket. Isaiah began with his
own story: an individual who, though he shared in the d sins
of the whole community, yet experienced salvation, _a_divine provision of cleansin ee Ty liation commission and cad beets
(see pp. . His address to Judah (7:1 — 9:7) and Israel (9:8 — 11:16) concluded with the same hope, the King whose coming would put all things to rights. In 126 we see the fruits of this royal work, a community in which each knows God’s saving
work (1-2), all drink the saving waters (3) and share a testimony
to the world (4-6). We notice therefore the first person singular
(I, me, my) of verses 1-2; and the second person plural (vou, coupled with plural imperatives) of 3-6. There cannot be a
transformed community without saved individuals; nor can there
be a saved individual who is not incorporated into the
community.
1-2. An unnamed voice (1a) affirms what the also unnamed
individual (1b—2) will say by way of personal testimony. Possibly
we are to think of Isaiah as the speaker: in 6:8 he spoke of
himself; now he foresees others along with him, unanimous in
testimony. Jn that day, i.e. the day alluded to in 11:10—-11, the day
when the Lord will have constituted a worldwide people as his
own and when his King reigns. You in verse la is second person
singular. This individual’s praise comes as a result of an
important sequence: divine anger (1c); its removal (1d); divine
comfort (le); personal experience of a divine Saviour (God is my
salvation, 2a); faith issuing in fearlessness ; the Lord
becoming the source of personal strength and joy (strength ...
song, 2c); assurance of salvation in and through the Lord (become my salvation, 2d). The basic problem of the sinner is the wrath of God. Were he not the Holy One there would be no need for salvation (Rom. 1:16-18), and until his wrath is propitiated there can be no salvation. Your anger has (1c) is more probably “Oh let your anger ...” — a mere plea is the only and sufficient course for the sinner to take. __ Verse 2 opens and closes with the affirmation that God himself is the source and the effecting of salvation: he is so (2a) because he wills to become so (2d). Between these two affirmations are four characteristics of the saved: the exercise of faith, the removal of fear, the infusion of strength, and the joy of song. Trust: in 7:9 trust was expressed by V’amén, pointing to the
108
ISAIAH 12:3-5
reliability of the one trusted, whereas here Vbatah points to the security into which the one who trusts enters. Hence it is followed by not be afraid. And this confidence is soundly based, ‘for’ (omitted in NIV) ‘my strength and song is Yahweh’ (cf, Ex. 15:2).' The objective mark of salvation is strength, durability in the face of life; and its subjecti is_ song, the inner we ng up of joy C Thes. 1:6). - To enter salvation is an individual experience (2) but to enjoy it is communal (3). You is here plural, and salvation which (2) is indeed an outreaching of God to the individual is also (3) an unfailing resource (wells) to which the saved community resorts with joy. Isaiah is following the community in its journey from Egypt, where individually they took shelter beneath the blood of the lamb, to the provision of water at Marah, and on to the wells at Elim (Ex. 15:25, 27).
4. The same voice speaks again as in verses 1 and 3, now
envisaging that the whole community will react as the prophet
himself_did_in 6:8, responding to the Lord and engaging in
proclamation. The responses are gratitude (for what the Lord has
done), worshipping him for what he is, and worldwide testimony
to his deeds and his person. Call on his name: of all the shades of
meaning of call on (qara’ b’, e.g. Ex. 34:5-6; 35:30; Is. 43:1), the
most suitable here is ‘to invoke the Lord in worship by using his
name’ (Gn. 12:8). His name is shorthand for all that he has
revealed about himself. Those to whom he has thus made himself
known enter into a worshipping intimacy with him. But their
secrets must be shared openly. They alone know what he has
done for them in salvation and they ceaselessly thank him; they
alone know the name of the Lord and they enter the privacy of
worship. They also have a duty: they must tell others what he has
done, share with others the revelation of the name which they have received.
5. Just as their personal gratitude and worship must, if they are
genuine, become public in testimony (4), so must their songs of
joy. Sing: Isaiah makes two important points. First, song is called
for not as an expression of inner elation but as a response to the
works of the Lord. It arises not from a stirring up of emotion but
from bending the mind to recall, ponder and understand his
! Isaiah seems to be trying deliberately to recapture the joy of the exodus in
this song of salvation. Thus, for example, he uses the archaic form of the word
song (zimrat; Ex. 15:2) and the affectionate diminutive of the divine name, Yah, which first appears in Ex. 15:2 and thereafter sporadically in the OT (e.g. Ps.
118:14). It is, of course, the final component in Hallelujah, ‘Praise Yah’.
109
ISAIAH 12:6
majestic deeds (Lk. 24:32). Secondly, true joy in what the Lord
has done overflows to the world in sharing this good news. :
6. For the last time the voice of verses 1, 3 and 4 speaks in
feminine singular imperatives to a feminine singular (not people
but) ‘inhabitant’ of Zion. The thought is drawn from Exodus
15:20-21, where Miriam led the songstresses in proclaiming
what the Lord had done at the Red Sea (cf 1 Sa. 18:6; Ps. 68:11).
The masculine singular of verse 1 is matched by the feminine
singular of verse 6. Thus this lovely song of joy in salvation is
bracketed by a stress on the individualism inherent in the
experience, but the contrasting male and female individuals
embrace the rejoicing community (3-5): neither is valid without
the other. Zion: Isaiah once saw_a different Zion with different
‘daughters’ (3:16 — 4:1), but now the promi ¢ :4)
has happened and the Holy once estranged (6:3—4), has
come home (cf. 4:5-6) to live among his people.
II. THE KINGDOM PANORAMA: THE WHOLE WORLD IN HIS HAND (13 - 27)
Throughout his vision of the coming King (chs. 7 — 11), Isaiah
has alluded to the worldwide dimension of the kingdom and its
unending rule (9:7) and to a time when the whole earth will be
the Lord’s holy mountain (11:9). He notes how the Lord’s remnant people, the coming worldwide Israel, who will be gathered
from Assyria and Egypt, and Philistia, Edom, Moab and Ammon
(11:14), will be part of the re-established kingdom of David.
These sidelong glances at the world dimension of what the
zeal of the Lord will do (9:7) now become the main theme of the
book. The ‘great’ powers of Babylon (13:1; 21:9), Assyria
(14:25) and Egypt (19:1) are reviewed along with the smaller
states of Philistia (14:29), Moab (15:1), Aram (17:1), Edom
(21:11), Arabia (21:13) and Tyre (23:1). Over all of them the
Lord rules in serene sovereignty, determining their experiences,
appointing their destinies, purposing to bring the whole world
together as one people (19:24—25) gathered (27:12-13) to himself. In the thick of this world scene the professing people of the
Lord live out their histories, condemned for their failures (17:1-
8; 22:1—-14) and yet central to the glory of the day when the Lord
reigns in Zion (24:23), the city of peace whose walls are
salvation and whose people are believing and righteous (26:14). _ The structure of this long and wonderful part of Isaiah is
important. There are three sections: chapters 13 — 20, 21 — 23 and
24 — 27. Of these the first two are each subdivided into five by the
110
ISAIAH 13 — 27
keyword ‘oracle’ (13:1; 14:28; 15:1; 17:1; 19:1; 21:1, 11, 13;
22:1; 23:1) and, as we shall see, the third main section also is in
five subdivisions, though without individual headings (24:1-20, 21-23; 25:1-12; 26:1-19; 27:1-13).
The oracle headings in the first section (chs. 13 — 20) are
straightforward, but in the second section (chs. 21 — 23) they are
(all except one) enigmatic, and it is only on reading the contents
of each oracle that the nature of its subject becomes obvious. In
section three only the changing topics indicate subdivisions. Thus
we move with Isaiah from the definite present, the world around
him (the precise headings) into the hazier future (the enigmatic
headings) and on to the remoteness of the eschaton, the Last Day
where, from Isaiah’s perspective, everything seems to merge into one.
These three series of five address one question as central to
living in this world: where is security to be found? A number of
solutions are considered: first, ‘The Superpower Solution’. The
question was first asked in Shinar (or Babel) (Gn. 11:19) and,
very properly, Isaiah considers the ‘Babylon’ solution first.
Babylon is the ‘superpower’, it represents the ‘imperialist
syndrome’, the world ordered by the imposition of centralized
government. But Babylon’s political domination will be broken —
it is as unacceptable to other nations as it is to the Lord (13:17-
19; 14:5); its man-made gods give it no protection (21:9) and it
will end as the ruined city (24:10), its gates broken (24:12)
because it broke the (divine) laws (24:5). In a word, human
efforts to unify the world as one ‘city’ are insufficient.
Second, ‘Hope Deferred, Hope Assured’: Philistia (the second
oracle in the first series, 14:28—32) may rejoice when the Davidic
monarchy seems to fail, but neither the monarchy (14:29) nor the
Lord’s purposes for Zion (14:32) are finished. It will take time
and long darknesses for his purposes to mature (21:11—12; oracle
two in the second series), but ultimately the Lord will reign
gloriously in Zion over the kings of the earth (24:21—23).
Third, ‘Pride and Collective Security’: in the third position in
each series Isaiah reviews the Gentile nations and reveals a world
doomed through proud refusal of the good news (Moab) and
determination to prove itself sufficient (Dedan). Moab (15:1 —
16:14), in dire straits, could find security in Zion (16:1-4), but it
is too proud to accept this solution (16:5-6). By.contrast, in
21:13-17, Gentiles turn to collective security in a time of need
but live to see its failure (21:16-17). Nevertheless, the day will
come when all nations (except Moab, excluded by pride) will
enjoy the Lord’s banquet on Mount Zion (25:6—10).
111
ISAIAH 13:1] — 14:27
Fourth, ‘The False Trails of the People of God’: in the fourth
place in each list Isaiah observes how Israel and Judah respond to
the threatening world around them. Israel (17:16) seeks security
in an alliance with Damascus (Aram, see on 7:1—9). But by
contrast Jerusalem chooses self-sufficiency (22: 9-11) — in each
case the Lord is the forgotten factor (17:10; 22:11). But worldly
strength is no security (17:4, 9) and self-sufficiency is the
unforgivable sin (22:14). Yet, one day, the Lord’s people will
enjoy the peace of salvation in the strong city (26:1-21). ;
Fifth, ‘The Triumphant End’: the Lord does not give up; his
purposes will prevail. The fifth passage in the threefold series
takes us right to the End when there will be one world, one
people, one God (19:24, 25), when even the irretrievably
materialistic Tyre will be (lit.) ‘holiness to the Lord’ (23:18) and
when, in the day of the Lord’s Jubilee, a worldwide community
will be gathered to his ‘holy mountain’ (27:12-13).
a. The first series of oracles: sure promises (13:1 — 20:6)
In chapters 6 — 12, Isaiah painted a Zion-centred picture of the
divine management of the world. This received a particular focus
in 10:5-15. The five oracles in this first series blend the
contemporary, the impending and the eschatological so as to
show that the Lord is in executive charge of his world for the
purpose of keeping his word and fulfilling his promises.
i. Babylon: a look behind the scenes (13:1 — 14:27). This
Babylon oracle is typical of the whole first series. Babylon was a
contemporary power but Isaiah begins by relating it to the Day of
the Lord (13:6-8) and to a universal and cosmic work of God
(13:9-13). Then, in case the remote should seem the unreal, he
provides an interim fulfilment in the attached Assyrian prediction (14:24-27), for if the Lord cannot demonstrate his governance of history in what people see before their very eyes, why should they trust him for what they cannot see? Equally, if they actually see him running the world, with even a superpower subject to his word, they are without excuse if they fail to trust his remoter promises.
We have here the two contesting superpowers of Isaiah’s day, Babylon and Assyria. Who could ‘doubt that world history would be shaped by them? Who but a prophet of the Lord?! Isaiah takes us behind the scenes: it is the Lord who is in command (13:3), who gathers his forces (13:4) and exacts moral retribution (13:9- 11). When earthly forces arise against existing powers, it is the Lord’s initiative (13:17); when dominant powers fall, it is the
112
ISAIAH 13:2-5
Lord who has cast them down (14:5-6); arrogance (14:13-14)
rnviey pers his judgment (14:22). He has planned and he will act
This is a general view of what the section teaches but the
structure of the whole displays another and very special truth.
The beckoning hand (13:2; ‘beckon’ is lit. ‘wave the hand’) at the
beginning is matched by the outstretched hand at the end (14:26).
Thus 13:2-16 (Al) declares a universal purpose and 14:24-27
(A2) exemplifies it (see 26); next, 13:17—22 (B1), the overthrow
of Babylon, is matched by 14:3-23 (B2), the overthrow of the
king of Babylon; and at the very centre of it all is 14:1-2 (C), a
contrasting universal purpose, the Lord’s compassionate purpose
for his people. This is what the course of history is all about: the
Lord giving central concern and loving attention to the fulfilment of his declared purpose for his chosen.
1. Babylon. Why did Isaiah begin his panorama of history with
Babylon as the representative superpower rather than the more
obvious candidate Assyria? First, as we saw in the Introduction
(pp. 21-23), Babylon was far from being a negligible power in
Isaiah’s time. Twice, under Merodach-Baladan, it established its
independence in the face of Assyrian dominance, and it would
have taken very astute political judgment to say which would
come out best in the Mesopotamian power stakes. Secondly,
Isaiah knew that Judah would one day be overthrown and
scattered (6:9-13) and he came to know that this destroying
power would not be Assyria (cf 8:8; 36 — 37). There was a dark
power in the shadows, biding its time. In due course (39:1-8) it
was revealed to him that that power was Babylon. In the ultimate,
therefore, Babylon is a more significant candidate for superpower
status than Assyria. But, thirdly, humanity’s bid to organize life
and create security and stability by its own resources and without
reference to God began at Shinar/Babel (Gn. 11:1—9). More than
any other name, therefore, ‘Babylon’ typifies humankind’s will to
be its own saviour. The Day of the Lord (13:2-16). ‘The Day’ is the culmination
and termination of history. Step by step Isaiah depicts its seven
aspects: it is the Day when the Lord implements his wrath (2-3), »
marked by worldwide mutual destruction (4-5) from which there
is no defence (6-8); it is cosmic in its effect (9-10), moral in its
motivation (11); it reverses the work of creation (12-13); there is
no escape, only horrific suffering (14-16). 2-5. ‘The gathering armies’. Gates (2) are the symbol of
defence. When the enemy enters the gates, the city has fallen (see
on 28:6). Nobles: the existing rulers of the world whom the Day
113
ISAIAH 13:6—13
will overthrow. My holy ones: not holy in themselves but
consecrated to, or eet apart for, the holy task of the Lord 's
warfare. Who rejoice: literally ‘my exulting ones of arrogance’.
These warriors exult in their own self-confident arrogance but
(unknown to themselves) they have been claimed by the Lord for
his purposes. The Lord is not on either side in this warfare (4-5).
Humanity’s armed strength comes together in an orgy of mutual
destruction (cf, Ezk. 38 — 39; Rev. 20:8). Mountains: historically,
Jerusalem often heard the sound of gathering forces on the hills
around. This is the picture here: it will be pre-eminently the case
on the Last Day (Ezk. 38:14-23; Rev. 20:9). Weapons of his wrath: the note of divine sovereign management of this final
battle continues. 6-8. ‘Helplessness’. The thought is of the immense forces
gathered to the Last Battle: such power as breathes destruction
(6), leaves people helpless and demoralized (7), strikes terror (8).
Near: at any moment the Day is already there, awaiting the
Lord’s command to dawn.' Hands ... heart: the organs
respectively of personal action and reflection. The terror of the
Day brings total personal paralysis. Woman in labour: not here a
picture of fruitful pain but of a process reaching its inescapable
outcome (1 Thes. 5:2-3). Aghast (Vtamah): i.e. not aghast with
fear but bereft of all certainty, in a state of confused indecision.
Aflame: in an agony of fear; maybe also in acute embarrassment
as the Day reveals that they have made all the wrong choices,
trusted wrong resources.
9-13. ‘Judgment on sin’. The notes of moral retribution (9)
and cosmic disaster (10) are sounded as marks of the Day. Cruel:
‘savage’ (see Je. 6:23). As verses 4-5 implied, on the human
level the Day is the climax of mutual hatred expressing itself in
mutual destruction. It is not, therefore, that the Lord acts savagely
but that sin is a savage thing in its outworking. On the divine
level, however, this savage outworking is the wrath of God
visiting on humankind its due. In verse 3, wrath (’ap) is anger expressed (cf. 10:5); in verse 5, wrath (za’am) is indignation felt; here it is “ebrd, anger overflowing, bursting out. For the first time
y 1 Destruction from the Almighty (6) exemplifies Isaiah’s skill with assonance (Sd misSadday). Almighty is an excellent contextual translation of Sadday, a word of uncertain meaning. It occurs as a divine title chiefly in Gn. 12 — 50, where the context requires ‘one who is almighty (in keeping his promises)’. His power does not flag like human power; he is at his most potent when people are at their most impotent. In the present context it refers to the God who is almighty to do whatever he wills. See J. A. Motyer, The Revelation of the Divine N T Press, 1959), pp. 28-30. lead CAC
114
ISAIAH 13:14-16
in the poem the moral motivation of the Day is mentioned.
Sinners (Vhata’, 9) points to acts astray from the norm; sins
(‘awon, 11) are the inner warp in fallen human nature; haughty ...
pride (11) is unwarranted, conceited self-esteem, expressing itself
(arrogance ... ruthless, 11) in superiority and unfeeling domination of others. This compressed summary of characteristics
and conduct which we tend to accept as commonplace brackets
verse 10: the reversal of the whole of creation. Truly the wages of
sin is death. Hence the awesome allusion to extermination in
verse 12! Ophir: unknown in location but famed for its gold (1
Ki. 9:28; Jb. 28:16). Tremble ... shake: see Jeremiah 4:22-26. The ordered movement of the heavens, the stability of the earth —
all that was achieved by creation — is undone in judgment. Wrath
.. anger as in verse 9, acting as an inclusio, rounding off this section.
14-16. ‘No escape’. The picture of gathering with which the
poem began (2-5) is balanced at the end by this picture of
scattering. In turn the verses reveal three facets of the Day: no
protection (14), no escape (15), no mercy (16). They gathered in
arrogant triumphalism (3-5), now they have everything to flee
from (14) and nowhere to flee to (15). Humankind without God is
without safety and without home. A// who are caught: literally
‘all who are swept away’, i.e. into flight from the ferocity of the
battle. But they might as well have stayed, for the sword will still
find them and, should any reach their home (16), it is to find that
the enemy got there first. In all this, of course, the Lord is no
puppet master making automata jump to his bidding (cf 10:5-
15). People are simply being themselves (Tit. 3:3). 14:26 notes
that the guiding power in history is the ‘stretching out of his
hand’. Yet in so many ways the Day is the withdrawing of his
hand as he judgmentally leaves sinners, unrestrained, to implement all the savagery of the fallen nature. The more people turn
their backs on God, determined to ‘be themselves’, to be masters
of ‘their own world’, the less human they become, therefore the
less humane. When the Day comes, sin will take centre stage as
the total and savage destroyer it has always been, and those who
did not want God will get what they wanted: they will be given
up (Rom. 1:24, 26, 28) to be themselves.
The end of Babylon’s kingdom (13:17-22). Having announced and described the Day of the Lord, Isaiah turns to the
foreseen fall of Babylon. It is typical of the Old Testament to see
coming calamity against the backdrop of ultimate calamity. Just
as every next king was eyed with the keen hope that he might be the promised king, so envisaged turmoil raised the question
15
ISAIAH 13:17-22
whether it might be the Last Battle; in any case, many of the
same issues are involved. ; vey
17-18. This case involves divine direction (J will stir) and
human energies (the Medes). Not just at the (last) Day but in all
its interim foreshadowings, the Lord is in executive management
of history. The choice of the Medes as the destroyers of Babylon
is unexpected. We are accustomed to think of Babylon falling to
the Persians but, on the other hand, often the Medes take priority over the Persians, as in ‘the law of the Medes and Persians’ (Dn.
6:8, 12) and the description of Babylon’s conqueror as “Darius
the Mede’ (Dn. 5:30).' We must leave it to Isaiah to have had his
own reasons for singling them out here. Silver ... gold: they
cannot be ‘bought off’; their sole motivation is conquest and in this they are merciless (18; cf 14-16). Strike down: ‘dash in pieces’. The verb is an unusual one in relation to death by arrow, but is probably chosen to make a link with its use in verse 16. The picture is of such a torrent of arrows striking home that
bodies are left ‘mangled/shot to pieces’. They have no concern
for life (young men), no restraint of pity (infants), no thought for
the future (children) — nothing but the fulfilment of their own imperialism!
19-22. Next Isaiah reviews the moral ground of the overthrow
(19), its permanence (20), completeness (21—22a) and proximity
(22b). Sodom and Gomorrah (19; Gn. 19) are the classic
instances of divine overthrow (cf. 1:7). The allusion underlines
the ultimate divine energy behind the ‘front-line’ activity of the
Medes. The absence of human inhabitant (20) and the
replacement of humankind by beasts (21-22) emphasize the
finality of the overthrow. And why has all this happened?
Because of the Babylonians’ pride (cf. 11). It is not only at the
Last Day but also in every interim experience of divine anger that
pride is a killer, leaving utter ruination and emptiness in its wake. Not even a passing Arab nomad nor a shepherd taking an afternoon siesta will be there, but only that which replaces (jackals, owls, hyenas) and repels human settlement. Desert creatures should probably be ‘desert wraiths’ and wild goats, *goat-demons’ (Lv. 17:7). The Bible can use folk superstitions simply for effect, without extending credence to them. Her time, (‘et): not a calendar date but a season appropriate to an event. Assyria destroyed Babylon in 689 BC (see ch. 21) but it

ISAIAH 14:1-2
recovered; likewise it was intact after Cyrus captured it (539 BC)
but its continued nuisance-value provoked Darius Hystapes to
desolate it in 518 BC, and so it has remained.
_ The heart of history: the Lord’s people (14:1-2). Here is a
vision of a new world in which co-operation has replaced
animosity. It is the new Day of the Lord in which the insensate
passion for mutual destruction has been replaced by unity (1de),
and hostility by helpfulness (2ab). But behind this display of a
new humanity there is divine initiative (compassion), choice and
settlement (labc). What actually happened at the return from
Babylon (539 BC) in no way fulfilled this: Cyrus, like many a
soldier turned politician, replaced the sword in his hand by the
tongue in his cheek (Ezra 1:24) and did what was to his own
advantage under guise of piety. There was no international
acclaim or will to help, no reversal of the captor-captive roles
(2c-f). In a word, just as the fall of Babylon was an interim
fulfilment of one side of the Day of the Lord, so the return was a
pale mini-reflection of the other — each an ‘earnest’ that the total
threat/ promise would yet be fulfilled.
1. The verse opens with a vitally important ‘For’, not translated by NIV: it is an explanation why history works the way it
does, whether on the grand scale of the Day or on the awesome
but smaller scale of interim ‘days’. Compassion (raham) is the
highly charged emotional devotion of a mother (1 Ki. 3:26).
Choose: i.e. implement the choice long since made (Dt. 7:7).
Settle: ‘give rest’, a traditional expression for peaceful security
(Dt. 12:10; 2 Sa. 7:1). Aliens: temporary residents who came
seeking asylum (Dt. 14:21, 29; cf Dt. 10:18-19; Lv. 25:23). In
the envisaged day of settlement they will be so enamoured with
the life of the Lord’s people that they too will want to settle. Join
... unite: the idea is doubled for emphasis. This will be a real and
true union.
2. For this reversal of roles, see 45:14-25; 49:22-26; 60;
66:19-24. Isaiah is still using the royal metaphor, possibly
looking back to 1 Samuel 17:8-9 when the erstwhile dominant
Philistines became servants. But it is still the voluntary and glad
relationship of verse 1. Jacob (1) and Jsrael will enjoy the wealth
of the nations (Ex. 12:33-36; Rev. 21:24-26) and be dominant
domestically (menservants), militarily (captives) and politically
(rule): but the reality, of course, is the spreading kingdom of
peace (9:7), of which the convert becomes a glad member (Ide)
and takes a servant’s place within the community of compassion.
The end of Babylon’s king (14:3-23). See pp. 296-297 and
the parallel section, 13:17-22 above. An introduction (3—-4a)
117
ISAIAH 14:3-6
blending this section with the theme of restoration (1-2) is
followed by the ‘song’ over the fallen king of Babylon (4b-21)
and a conclusion (22, 23) which turns the final thought of the
song into a divine affirmation. :
3—4a. David (2 Sa. 7:1) and Solomon (1 Ki. 8:56) mistakenly
thought the Lord’s purposes had been fulfilled in their day, but all
they experienced was an interim day of rest. The fullness still
awaits the Day. Suffering (‘oseb) is related to the ‘painful toil’
(issab6n) of Genesis 3:16. Its ending here signifies the removal
of the curse. Turmoil (rogez) is restless insecurity. Cruel bondage
is the exact expression found in Exodus 1:14. There will be no
more oppression or oppressor but full redemption with all its
fruits. Taunt: the notion of ‘jeering’ is not suitable to the song or
to the word used here; maSal is a proverb or parable, a saying or
way of putting something so that its inner meaning comes to light. This is the intention here: to express the inner realities
involved in the fall of Babylon’s king. In verses 4b—21, the song about the king of Babylon,’ the
earth reacts to the end of oppression (al; 4b—8) and Sheol reacts
to the arrival of the king (bl; 9-10); the king’s arrival in Sheol
(b2; 11-15) contrasts dramatically with his ambition to reach the
apex of heaven, and his reputation on earth (a2; 16-21) contrasts
with his lot after death.
4b-6. The single oppressor (4) contrasts with the plural
wicked ... rulers (5). The king against whom the Lord finally acts
is the culmination of a long line of culpability: biblically this
does not excuse him but rather (Lk. 11:50-51) makes him the
inheritor as well as the perpetrator of wickedness. There is no
point asking which king of Babylon Isaiah has in mind. If it had
been essential to know, he would have told us. The description is
standard for the arbitrary and totalitarian rulers of the ancient
empires. The point is not to show how the Lord dealt with this or
that ruler but to draw out principles of the divine government of
history. The power of earthly rulers is real (rod ... sceptre; cf. on
10:5-15), and they are answerable to God for their malevolence
(anger ... fury),’ their reign of terror (unceasing blows), and their
' The authorship of this song is disputed, but needlessly. Erlandsson, The Burden of Babylon, p. 128, notes that 83% of the words occurring here are found in the agreed work of Isaiah. Of the remaining 23 words, 17 are pre-exilic and the six words alleged to be ‘late’ are found on examination not to be so. ? In v. 4 fury represents the unknown Heb. word madhebd. Q* reads marhebd, which, though it does not occur elsewhere, is traceable to the verb ‘to be arrogant’, found in 30:7. LXxX could well have invented the Gk. word epi- spoudastés, meaning ‘one who presses on’.
118
ISAIAH 14:7-15
belligerent refusal to tolerate any point of view but their own (relentless aggression). Oppression (4, 6) on earth is noted in heaven and the wicked will be punished.
7-8. Not only people but trees rejoice at the end of the
oppressor. The levelling of the New Forest to supply Nelson’s
fleet, the poor shattered trees on World War 1 battlefields, and the
criminal defoliation of Vietnamese forests, all tell the tale of
creation’s suffering in human wars. But there is more in the
reference to Lebanon, for it typifies God’s, not human, ordering
and beautifying of creation (Ps. 104:16). To cut down Lebanon is
to seek to be like God. But note how the king himself (19) is a
rotten branch: the arrogant woodman has indeed ‘had the chop’.
In verses 9-15, Isaiah takes us on an imaginative trip to Sheol,
the abode of the dead. We hear how Sheol reacts to the arrival of
the king (9-10) and what a contrast this is (11-15) to his
ambitions and self-estimation. Imaginative though this is, great
Old Testament truths are accurately expressed. First, the dead are
alive. In the Bible ‘death’ is never ‘termination’ but always
change of place (from earth to Sheol), change of state (from
body-soul unity to the separate life of the soul) and continuity of
person. Thus, in Sheol, there is personal recognition: the king is
recognized as he arrives (10); the existing residents rise from
their thrones — not because there are thrones in Sheol but because
they are the same people as once they were on earth. But the dead
are ‘shades/shadowy ones’ (9), weak (10) because death has sundered body and soul; the soul by itself is but a half-life. The Old
Testament awaits the Lord Jesus to meet its implied need of the
resurrection of the body. This is an illustration of the progressive,
cumulative revelation which runs throughout the Bible.
9-10. The grave (NIV mg. ‘Sheol’): the place name of the
abode of the dead. See further on verse 11. The spirits of the
departed: the single Hebrew word, rpa’im, is of uncertain
| meaning. It is probably related to Vrapa, ‘to sink down, droop’,
hence some such translation as ‘shadowy ones’.' Leaders:
literally ‘he-goats’, leaders of the herd, boundless in assertive
virility. The word is ironical: ‘shadowy, flabby he-goats!’ Weak
from Vhaié, to be sick, ineffectual. 11-15. The second part of the visit to Sheol opens with pomp
... brought down to the grave (11) and ends with you ... brought
1 ‘Rephaim’ was the name given to some pre-Israelite inhabitants of Canaan
(Dt. 2:11, 20: 3:11), noted for their fearsome power. For this reason the identity of
spelling with ‘the shadowy ones’ can only be coincidence. Contrast Jb. 26:5; Ps.
88:18; Pr. 2:18.
119
ISAIAH 14:16—20c
down to the grave (15). Grave should, of course, be Sheol. It is
not the cemetery where the body lies but the ‘place’ where the
soul continues in life. Yet they are not unrelated, for the cemetery
too has a testimony to bear. What a bed for a king! What a
bedspread! The grave exposes the fragility of our humanity, for
the body too is spoken of as you; it, as much as the soul, is the
person. The dissolution of the one in the grave matches the
weakness of the other in Sheol. In the light of all this, how 2 Corinthians 4:16 —5:5 comes into its own!
Morning star (hélél, 12) alludes to the Canaanite myth of
Helal/Ishtar who attempted a heavenly coup that failed. The Old
Testament uses allusions like this without attributing reality to the
characters concerned. The king had, mentally at least, made his
own bid for the heights — but look at him!
In verses 13-15 we look into the king’s heart, at his secret
ambitions in contrast to (12) his public achievements. Note the
progressively upward movement of his soaring self-esteem: stars,
the highest visible realities; mount of assembly refers to the
mythological belief that the gods lived on mountains (as in
Greece on Olympus). The king thus envisaged his deification.
But more, he aspired to the chief place among the gods, utmost
heights ... sacred mountain, literally ‘the apex of Zaphon’.
Mount Zaphon, in north Palestine, was the seat of the Canaanite
gods. It is mentioned in Psalm 48:2. But the king plans to go
higher, above the tops of the clouds to be like the Most High. The
Bible has no animus against godly ambition (Phil. 3:13-14; 1
Thes. 4:11 with Rom. 15:20; 2 Cor. 5:9), but equally it insists
that, where human arrogance reaches after the stars, it grasps the
pit. Tellingly here depths (15) is the same Hebrew word as utmost
heights (13). Grave is Sheol again. Pit is used as a synonym for
a8) its more threatening aspects (e.g. Pss. 28:1; 143:7; Is.
In verses 16-21 the poem returns to the earthly scene, to
contrast what the king might have expected with what actually
happened: not a state funeral (18) but a trampled corpse (19, 20a— c); not an honoured succession but slaughtered sons (20d—21). 16-17 dwell on the king’s power — over the work of God (16c, 17a), the work of human beings (16d, 17b) and people (17c). 18-20c point out the contrast. Zomb: ‘house’, used here of the ornate mausoleums in which the great ones of earth seek to perpetuate their superiority. Branch (néser): as in 11:1. He is a ‘shoot’ of kings but is reckoned fit only for the compost heap! Once he wore royal robes; now he is (lit.) ‘clothed with the slain’, his body covered only by the foot-soldiers whom his
120
ISAIAH 14:20d-23
arrogance directed into his battles and to their death. The stones
of the pit is the rock-bottom of Sheol. Join them: i.e. the kings
mentioned in verse 18. He was, of course, no worse than they (cf,
the plurals of 5-6) — and the question has to be asked, ‘Why he?’
Because the world is run by a just God, who allows people time
for repentance (2 Pet. 3:9, 15) and lets iniquity work until it is
full (Gn. 15:16). Providence waits, probation works out, judgment falls.
20d—21. The Old Testament forbids human judicial processes
to punish children for parental sins (Dt. 24:16) but, by the
providential ordering of God the Creator, there is a price to be paid for being human and, for good or ill, there is a moral entail
(Ex. 20:56; Pr. 20:7) working out under his just rule. Wicked
(m*ré‘im, ‘evil-doers’) is not the same word but is the same idea
as in verse 5, and forms a judgmental inclusio for the section.
This brilliant, surging poem is a horrific description of
devastation, carnage, disappointed hopes, dead sons, a shattered
environment. The wages of sin is death.
22-23 portray ‘the Lord of history’. The downfall of Babylon
took a long time to happen. In spite of falling to the Assyrians in
689 BC and to Cyrus in 539, it was Darius in 516 who pushed it
past the point of no return. The Bible, however, makes us look
beyond second causes (here superior empires, greater rulers,
stronger armies) and beyond the prolonged processes of history
to the First Cause and the sole determinative factor: J will rise ...
cut off ... turn ... sweep. World government (22a), the termination
of imperial tenure (22cd), transformation (23a) and obliteration
(23b) are traced to the fourfold J of divine initiative and action. It
is not because the Bible is ignorant of second causes or denies
their effectiveness that it so constantly traces all directly to the
hand of God; it is because it would have us live by faith.
Preoccupation with second causes encourages people to ‘work
the system’, pull strings; focusing on the First Cause calls us to
trust and to live in the obedience of faith. Declares ... declares
(n°um): see 1:24. Notice its use three times, like a triple seal of
authenticity. Almighty: ‘of hosts’, see 1:9.
Assyria: a test case, an interim assurance (14:24-27). Just
as, when the Day of the Lord comes, his hand will beckon to
earth’s forces to gather to the Last Battle (13:2-3), so in every
movement of history, every foreshadowing of that Day, it is the
Lord’s outstretched hand (26) that rules earth’s experiences.
Through his prophet the Lord has allowed his people to look
forward — to the eschaton itself (13:2-16), to the coming fall of a
contemporary power (13:17-22) and its king (14:3-21). He has
121
ISAIAH 14:24—-28
revealed to them that they are at the heart of his historical
providences (14:1-2) and that it is he who is the executive of
world affairs (14:22-23). Can they believe all this? Has he got
them at the heart of his plans? Is he really the world ruler? Can
he master earth’s superpowers? In answer to these questions
Isaiah in effect replies, ‘Watch this space’, for in 701 BC, within
the experience of those he addresses, they will see the hand of
their God in their own deliverance and the overthrow of great Assyria. Faith is not credulity, wishful thinking or a leap in the
dark. Rather, it is a leap into the light, for faith is conviction and action based on evidence. When they see what happens to
Assyria they can believe about Babylon, and, beyond Babylon,
about the Day of the Lord. Isaiah could not have chosen a more persuasive example. In his day Babylon was a great power (see
ch. 39), a real challenge to Assyrian domination and to the
balance of power in Mesopotamia, but only intermittently so. The
real superpower, dominant, savage, irresistible, was Assyria. The
Lord commits himself in advance to deal with Assyria (24-25)
and then asserts that this is the model for the divine universal
purpose (26-27).
24-25. As in verses 22-23, there are four first-person verbs. J
have planned ... By this neat literary move, Isaiah sets the
specific case of Assyria in the context of the Lord’s universal
action. It is a case in point. Planned (\dam@) ... purposed
(Vya‘as): the former is the plan in the mind, the latter its
formulation as a scheme of action. Jn my land: this was also the
locus of the Last Battle (5, 9). The Lord will bring the Assyrian
forces right into his own land (8:6-8; 10:5-15; 36-37) and
overthrow them there. Yoke ... burden: the wording is as in 10:27.
26-27. On the universal scale there is need only for an
outstretched hand, universal in its coverage (26b), irresistible in
ic se (27cd). Plan, determined and purposed are all ya‘as see 24).
ii. Philistia: the Lord’s sure promises to David (14:28-32).
28. For the second time (see 6:1), Isaiah dates an oracle by a death. Ahaz was a significant king to Isaiah for, as we have seen, the prophet understood Ahaz’ refusal to walk by faith and his commitment to political salvation by an alliance with Assyria (see 7:1ff.; Introduction, pp. 19-20) as being the death knell of the dynasty of David. Would that happen with his death? Throughout the Assyrian period Philistia was a ceaseless agitator for rebellion. In 734 BC Gath refused tribute and was sacked; in 720 Philistia connived with Egypt to rebel, and Sargon II
122
ISAIAH 14:29-30
defeated Egypt at Gath and took Askelon and Gaza; in 711
Ashdod was somehow central to an unsuccessful west Palestinian
revolt; in 705 Ashkelon rebelled and fell to Sennacherib in his
campaign of 701. The death of Ahaz in 715 could well have been
the occasion of a Philistine approach to Hezekiah with a view to
joint anti-Assyrian action. At any rate such an embassy, maybe
under cover of a mission of condolence on the death of his father,
is a scenario which fits this oracle like a glove. We can start by
asking what question would prompt the answer proposed in verse
32 with its emphasis ‘It is the LORD who has founded Zion and it
is in it that his downtrodden people will find refuge’. Was another
foundation — an alliance with Philistia and Egypt — being
proposed? Another refuge for a small, beleaguered people? To
Isaiah all this was pernicious. The times might well be menacing
and the prospect of recovering independent sovereignty enticing,
but all the security Zion and its people needed was in the Lord.
Typically of Isaiah this oracle is a balanced statement.
29-30, The first contrast: ultimate destinies. The house of
David has a strong future (29cd) but not Philistia (30cd). When
Ahaz decisively refused the way of faith (7:9) the doom of the
monarchy was sealed, yet Isaiah at once affirmed the hope of
Immanuel (7:14). So here, on the death of the unbeliever, Isaiah
reasserts the promises. David was the rod that struck you, for no
other king of Judah was so completely victorious over Philistia (1
Sa. 17:50; 18:25-30; 19:8; 23:1-5; 2 Sa. 5:17—25; 8:1). But with
Ahaz the rod ... is broken, for up to that time the sovereign
independence of David’s house had remained intact but from
Ahaz onwards the Davidic king was a vassal until the dynasty disappeared altogether. Thus the Philistines, even though they
hoped to win Hezekiah’s support for an anti-Assyrian alliance,
could rejoice that they had nothing further to fear from that
quarter. Rod ... snake: see Exodus 4:2-3; 7:10-12. The house of
David may be broken but the Lord can make even the broken rod
into a venomous serpent. For the inner meaning of victory over
Philistia, see on 11:14.
Poorest of the poor (30): literally ‘the firstborn of the poor’,
but it is unclear what the expression means. There may be a clue in seeing ‘firstborn’ as an exodus motif (Ex. 4:22). In Egypt,
Israel seemed doomed and helpless but, as the Lord’s ‘firstborn’,
proved triumphant. On poor, see 10:2; needy, from v’abd, to be
willing — in the good sense, to be pliant to the will of God, and in
the bad sense, to be subject to the will of stronger forces,
exploited. Yet, in Egypt, resourceless and defenceless though
they were, they became victorious. Maybe the expression here
123
ISAIAH 14:31-32
could be translated, ‘the firstborn, poor though they be’. Find
pasture: another exodus motif (Ps. 77:20). :
In other words, though David is gone and his house a poor
broken thing, there are secret vitalities at work guaranteeing
triumph; though David’s people endure a new Egypt experience,
there will also be a new exodus and a people provided for by
shepherding care. But it is otherwise for Philistia. Whatever holds
promise for the future (roof) or exists in the present (survivors) is
doomed.
31-32, The second contrast: immediate fortunes. The
Philistines are helpless before the threat from the north (31); but
Zion is secure in the Lord (32). The gate is the key target in an
attack. Once the gate is breached the city falls. Melt: the verb
(mig) is used of being ‘demoralized, no heart for resistance’ (Jos.
2:9, 24). Smoke is the dust cloud raised here by the advancing
armies (cf Song 3:6). North: the Mesopotamian powers were
always seen as ‘northerners’ because from the east they marched
round the Fertile Crescent and came against the Palestinian states
from the north. The reference here is to the Assyrian attack in 701.' But the future for Zion is different. In the face of the same
threat it is secure. Verse 32 begins with ‘and’, i.e. in the light of
the foregoing exposure of Philistine helplessness what sort of
reply should be offered to their suggestion of an anti-Assyrian
alliance? Answer shall be given is a perfectly idiomatic translation, treating the third-person singular verb as an indefinite (i.e.
‘should one give’ = ‘should be given’) but it might also be
translated ‘should he give’, that is, Hezekiah, when approached
by the envoys. This, then, would be Isaiah’s reply, the reply of a
stout and steady faith. First, the prior reality of the Lord himself:
literally ‘It is the LORD who ...’. Secondly, the status already
enjoyed by Zion’s people: they live in the city the Lord chose and
where his promises have their home (e.g. 28:16): Thirdly, human
weakness is not a factor in the situation: afflicted (i.e.
downtrodden, at the bottom of life’s heap) they may be, in their
own and others’ estimation, but they are his and are in her, in Zion, his chosen city (Heb. 12:22-24). Fourthly, refuge is open to them to flee to, for in Zion the Lord lives among his people.
iii. Moab: salvation refused by pride (15:1 — 16:14). The Babylon oracle (13:1 — 14:23) focused on the centrality of the
' Straggler (31) is uncertain. Lit. ‘... none by himself/standing alone at his appointed times/in his appointed company’. Some suggest the word (bédé, mean ‘deserter’. Q* offers no help. fer = Sta an)
124
ISAIAH 15:1-4
people of God (14:1-2) in his executive control of world history;
the Philistia oracle (14:28-32) confirmed this by affirming the
Davidic promises and the certainty that the Lord would honour
them. The Moab oracle follows in sequence, by correcting any
impression that the promises are exclusivist: the promises which
will be fulfilled in Zion embrace all who take refuge there — even
Moab! As regards date, it is certain that Moab, like all the
Palestinian states, suffered in the Assyrian crisis — Sargon II in
715 and 711 Bc, Sennacherib in 701 — but beyond that neither the
past tenses of 15:1 nor the future tenses of 16:13 offer enough
evidence to relate the events described to specific defeats. Indeed,
it is possible that the tenses of 15:1 express future certainty rather
than past fact, in which case 15:1 and 16:13 refer to the same
overthrow and would presumably find fulfilment in Sennacherib’s
attack on the west (Introduction, pp. 20-21). Certainly in any
invasion by the pitiless Assyrians all that 15:1-9 describes would
be true but, as so often, Isaiah’s concern is with the principles
central to a situation, not with dates, times and personalities.
Even the foe remains vague as the rulers of the nations (16:8). In
this way Isaiah lifts a certain tract of history on to a new level: a
Gentile people is in dire straits (15:1-9) and turns to Zion for
help (16:1—4a); it hears the reply that the time of aggression is
temporary but the throne of David is permanent (16:4b—5), an
implicit invitation to find security by coming under the governance of Zion and the shadow of the Davidic king; Moab, however, cannot bear to lose face in this way; pride inhibits
responding even to such good news (16:6), and in consequence
Moab’s sorrows continue (16:7-11); there is no other refuge
(16:12) and only destruction awaits (16:13). Isaiah’s purpose is
not to mark out a situation with dates and names but to use
history to depict truth: the needy can find salvation by identifying
with the people of God and coming within the embrace of his
promises, but pride is a killer.
1, Moab’s crisis. Ar was a border town (Dt. 2:18); Kir,
probably Kir Hareseth (16:7, 11), was in central Moab (2 Ki.
3:25). The picture is of an invasion which has broken the border
defences and penetrated to the heartland. Ruined: as 6:5,
‘silenced’, the silence of the dead; the silence of a city which
flight has emptied of people. Jn a night: an attack of such speed,
power and ferocity that ittook onlyasingle night
2-4, Moab’s grief. People turn to religion in their grief (2);
despair spreads from town to town (3—4ab); the military are as
overwhelmed as the civilians (4cd). Dibon, north of the Arnon;
Nebo and Medeba further north still. The heaping up of names
125
ISAIAH 14:5-9
creates the impression of widespread disaster and helplessness.
Shaved: the cutting of the hair was a sign of mourning (22:12;
Mi. 1:16). Streets ... roofs: the mourning becomes local and
domestic. The sorrows of war are not abstract; they come right
into the home. Heshbon (Nu. 21:26), Elealeh (Nu. 32:3, 37) and
Jahaz (Nu. 21:23) are all in the plains of Moab and the furthest
north of the cities named. Moab has become one single weeping
entity. The tragedy is so overwhelming that the soldiers are
immobilized by grief.
5-9, The Lord’s grief over Moab. My heart (5) leads on to I
will bring (9), identifying the speaker as the Lord grieving over
the fugitives (5), the environment (6), the pathetic efforts to
salvage something from the disaster (7-8) and the further suffering ahead (9). This is all joined together in the Hebrew by
the explanatory word ‘for’ seven times: before they go and on the road in verse 5; before the waters and instead of and (the grass)
in 6; also at the beginning of 8 and 9, and instead of but in 9. In
this way the verses are a long catalogue of what agonizes the
Lord, who weeps even as he smites. Just as this Moab oracle
corrects a possible misapprehension in the Philistia oracle (14:28ff.) by showing that the Davidic promises embrace the
Gentiles, so it adjusts the Babylon oracle (13:1ff.). There the
divine nature expressed itself in holy wrath; but there is another
side to the Lord, a heart of astonishing sympathy and empathy, compassion and identification with human suffering.
5. In contrast to verses 2-4, the list of towns here runs southwest. The enemy comes from the north and Moab flees
southwards. Zoar (Gn. 19:21—22) is in the southern Dead Sea
area. Eglath Shelishiyah is unknown; Lulith and Hornaim (Je.
48:5) must have been in the same area.
6. Nimrim (Nu. 32:3, 36; Jos. 13:27) is probably Wadi Numeirah in southern Moab.
7-8. One of the most pathetic sights of war is the plight of
civilians caught up in a disaster not of their making, and left to
salvage what they can from the misfortune. Imperial glory comes
at the expense of those at the bottom, not those at the top. The Ravine of the Poplars may be Wadi Zered on the southern border of Moab (Nu. 21:12; Dt. 2:13). Eglaim and Beer Elim are unknown. Maybe they are the ‘Dan and Beersheba’ of Moab, expressing the whole length of the land. 9. Dimon may be an alternative name for Dibon (2), forming an inclusio. Isaiah could well have chosen this form of the name for assonance sake: mé-dim6én mali dam, ‘the waters of Dimon are full of blood’, which would have appealed to his poetic
126
ISAIAH 16:1—4b
sense.' There is an allusion to 2 Kings 3:22-23, where Moab
once saw a mirage of blood, but now it is all too real — and their
own! But even rivers running with blood do not satisfy the holy
justice of God, ‘for’ J will bring still more. Tears (5) and just
inflictions (9) are at one in the divine nature. Lion is used here as
a metaphor for an implacable assailant who will destroy alike
those who seek to escape and those who opt to stay, that is, all
without exception. 2 Samuel 23:20 and 1 Chronicles 11:22
mention ‘ariels’ of Moab, apparently élite warriors of some sort.
The title means ‘lion of God’. It is a subtlety worthy of Isaiah to
threaten a lion (aryéh) on the land of ariels. Did they boast of
lions? Lions they shall have!
16:1-4b, Moab’s plea. The scene changes. Isaiah writes as
though overhearing Moab’s ‘Cabinet’ discussing what to do.
They are meeting at Sela in the far south whither, presumably, the
government has fied and now pleas for help. In panting,
breathless Hebrew the prophet reflects their panic.
1. Lambs were the traditional Moabite tribute (2 Ki. 3:4),
implying a request for vassal status. Desert: the desert of
southern Judah, which emissaries from Sela would have to cross.
Ruler is intentionally vague. They feel themselves compelled to
become tributary to the Davidic king but cannot bring themselves
to say so.
2. Even though they have acted for their own safety in fleeing
to Sela, the government are not without thought for their people,
and what drives them to seek Judah’s protection is news coming
from sixty miles to the north — and near the bloodied waters of
Dibon (15:9) — where terrorized Moabite girls are desperate to
cross the Arnon to gain some small protection from the enemy.
3-4b records the message the envoys would take to Zion.”
First, they appeal for immediate advice (counsel) and decision
(3ab); next, they present their problem figuratively: they are like
people exposed to the blinding glare of the noonday sun and
needing the relief of shadow (3c); thirdly, they ask that fugitives
(‘those driven out’) be admitted to Judah (3d) and that all
demands for extradition be refused (do not betray, 3e); and,
finally, they request that those ‘driven out’ from Moab be
1 Q* reads ‘Dibon’ instead of ‘Dimon’ in each case.
2 The verbs in v. 3 are difficult. There is a textual variation whereby the first
verb may be either 2nd person plural or 2nd person singular feminine; the second
verb is 2nd person plural and the third and fourth verbs are 2nd person singular
feminine. It would be easy to make them all 2nd person singular feminine, as an
address of Zion (see BHS). If the first two verbs can be treated as 2nd plural, they
represent discussion among the Moabite leaders.

accepted as resident aliens (4ab). Stay is Vgir, used technically
for the right of temporary residence or political asylum. 2
4c-5, Isaiah’s answer. As in 14:32, Isaiah proposes what his
own answer would be to such an appeal from Moab. Outside this
passage we have no knowledge of a Moabite approach during the
Assyrian crisis — though the circumstances of the time make it far
from unlikely — and no record of any reply. But Isaiah’s reply
here is thoroughly consistent with his thinking. In his eyes Zion’s
strength is not in military resources. Zion’s strength is in the Lord
and in the Davidic monarchy on which the divine promises were concentrated. He therefore replies that present crises pass (4cde)
but the throne of David will endure (5). The implication plainly is
that, if Moab is serious about wanting a secure future, they must come in on a faith basis within the protected enclave of the
Lord’s promises to David. There is a great difference in style between 4cde and 5. In
speaking of the crisis (4) Isaiah imitates the excited speech of the
envoys, but changes to a majestic calmness when he speaks of
the Davidic security. This is in effect what he has on offer: an
escape from pressures and uncertainties into the calm certainties
of faith and hope. First, he offers them an unchanging God. Love
is hesed, the Lord’s covenanted (therefore unchanging) commitment to his people, his steadfastness, unmoved by changing times
or experiences, undeviating even when they proved faithless.
Secondly, there is a perpetual kingdom. The throne ... established
contrasts with what Moab was experiencing, the fickleness of
human political fortunes. Thirdly, there is an undoubted king. In
the house (lit. ‘tent’) of David: not a usurper, but one with a true
lineage and right to rule, and, most of all, the inheritor of the
promises made to David. ‘Tent’ is a more personal word than
even house, with the nuance of ‘home’ rather than merely an
address. A discreditable example like 2 Samuel 16:22 shows this,
as does the idiomatic expression for ‘going home’ in 2 Samuel 20:1, 22. The king is a genuine descendant of David, living by right in David’s personal home. And, fourthly, the king will rule in faithfulness (the opposite of fickleness, unreliability), justice and righteousness (see on 1:21). This is the promised Davidic restoration. In a word, what Isaiah would offer the Gentiles is Zion’s messianic best. His faith was consciously universal: all ie ee to Zion are welcome under the banner of the house of avid.
_ 6-8, Moab’s grief explained. The return of Moab to tears implies that the terms on which security could be found in Zion were not acceptable — and the reason given is Moab’s pride,
128
ISAIAH 16:6-10
conceit and insolence. Had they been asked for a higher tribute
price, their pride would have been intact, but the simple price of
submitting to Zion’s king was too high.
6. The four nouns pride ... pride ... conceit ... pride all spring
from Vga’, ‘to be high’. Its good sense is ‘majesty’ (2:10; 4:2);
its bad sense ‘haughtiness’, an inflated sense of self-worth.
Insolence (‘ebra) often means ‘(overflowing) anger’ (10:5), but
here ‘effrontery’, a self-esteem that overflows in every direction.
On all this Isaiah comments that her boasts (inventions, living in
a world of unreality) are empty. It is the way of faith, trusting the
Lord’s promises, that is the way of reality.
7. Therefore (7) introduces the consequences of refusing
security in Zion: wailing (7) and withering (8). Wail ... lament ...
grieve: the first is the vocal expression of grief, the second is the
‘groan’ of grief inwardly felt and the third is the prostration of
grief, what we mean by ‘grief-stricken’. Kir Hareseth: see 15:1.
Men: ‘raisin cakes’ (see NIV mg.). Other occurrences of this
phrase (2 Sa. 6:19; 1 Ch. 16:3; Song 2:5; Ho. 3:1) do not help to
explain the significance here, except perhaps that such cakes may
have been considered a delicacy. Possibly, therefore, as spreading
vines (8) symbolize influence extending abroad, ‘raisin cakes’
represent the joys and prosperity known at home.
8. Heshbon and Sibmah are unknown. Jazer (Nu. 21:32; Jos.
13:25) was on the extreme northern border of Moab. The desert
lay east and the sea to the west. The picture is of a country
extending its influence in all directions.
9-12, The Lord’s grief over Moab. Isaiah is still drawing out
the consequences of Moab’s pride: verses 7—8, the consequences
for Moab; 9-12, the consequences for the Lord — who mourns
over the past, what Moab has lost (9-10), and over the future
(11-12), the fact that Moab now has nowhere to turn for help.
9-10. So: ‘therefore’ (cf 7). I weep (9a): the subject is
identified by IJ have put an end (10d). The thought is the same as
15:5-9. What the Lord visits in holy justice he laments with holy
sorrow. It is we who find tension between his justice and love;
but the divine nature is one, and all the Lord’s attributes are in
perfect harmony (Ps. 145). In 15:5 he wept over Moab; now he
weeps as Jazer weeps, literally ‘in the weeping of Jazer’. His
tears and theirs are mingled as one; he is no onlooker on the
world’s sorrows (even though self-inflicted) but a- participant
(even though the suffering is his just visitation). Attention has
shifted from the withering of the vines (8) to the joy that formerly
marked the vineyards and the vintage. Moab’s choice of the way
of pride has proved to be a joyless experience, and it grieves the
129
ISAIAH 16:11-14
Lord when even Moab no longer finds happiness in his creation
and its fruits. ;
11-12 should be introduced by ‘therefore’ as in 9 (cf 7). This
is the third consequence of Moab’s pride, and again it focuses on
the Lord’s grief, now over the helpless position into which pride
has led Moab. They rejected salvation in Zion and there is no
alternative salvation, no matter what effort is expended (wears
herself out) or what religious exercises are practised (pray).
13-14, Moab’s imminent ruin. Isaiah introduces a second
‘interim fulfilment’ (see 14:24-27). What is predicted and fulfilled within three years gives ground for confident faith in the
remoter and greater promises of God. Probably this prediction
was elicited by a Moabite enquiry (cf 21:11—12). The prophets
were sought out by Gentile enquirers (e.g. 2 Ki. 8:7ff.). The Assyrian crisis provoked intense diplomatic activity between the
Palestinian states. If Isaiah published 15:1 — 16:12 to coincide
with a Moabite embassy, seeking to press on them his sense of
their critical plight and the solution he had to offer, one or more
Moabites could well have come to him for clarification. On the
other hand, the prophets used the technique of addressing absent
audiences (Moab) in order to teach present hearers (Judah), here
enforcing the lessons of forsaking pride and resorting to faith. In
this case the time-factor not only provides an interim fulfilment
and therefore ground for faith but also a proper stress on the
urgency to respond. As a servant: a hired hand is a clock-watcher.
Hence, three years here means ‘three years exactly’. Moab’s payday has been fixed. Splendour ... many people: no status or
resources can fend off the calamity. Humanly speaking, downfall
might be ‘against the odds’, but if the Lord has decreed it the
matter is settled, and if the Lord’s salvation has been refused nothing can save.
iv. Damascus/Ephraim: the way of death and the promise
of life (17:1 — 18:7). In each of the three sets of oracles that make
up this part of Isaiah, the Lord’s people occupy the fourth
position (cf 22:1-25; 26:1-21), here the northern people, Ephraim (17:3, 4-6). But why does Isaiah conceal Ephraim behind an apparent address to Damascus, the capital city of the kingdom of Aram? This is precisely the point: the people of the Lord live out their histories within world history. They are part of the fivefold roll-call of the nations which makes up the series. They are not immune from the demands, pressures, questions and temptations of life in this world. In Isaiah’s time, they too were a small kingdom among the kingdoms and therefore faced the same
130
ISAIAH 17: 1-3
problem: where is security to be found? Ephraim’s answer, when
up against the Assyrian threat, was to turn to Aram (see on 7:1ff.;
Introduction, pp. 19-20), to sink its national identity in that of its
more forceful erstwhile enemy, coming together in an AramEphraim defensive alliance. Ephraim’s hard experience taught
that to identify with the world for salvation was to be caught up in the world’s destruction.
We must not be unrealistic about Ephraim’s problem. Think of
any small state in our own time threatened with absorption into a
superpower! Collective security must have seemed an obvious,
even wise way forward. But they could adopt it only at the
expense of forgetting their saving God, their strong Rock (17:10).
In the scheme of these oracles, the Lord has affirmed (14:1—2)
that he sovereignly governs world history to make and keep his
people secure; he never revokes his promises (14:32); and the
way of salvation for Gentiles is to submit to Zion and its king
(16:4-5; cf Ps. 2:10—-12). But Ephraim is here found seeking
_ security in Damascus, not in the Lord, failing to trust his promises and reversing his intended procedures by finding salvation in
a Gentile power instead of opening a way of salvation to the
Gentiles.
The two nations (17:1-11). The first half of the Damascus/Ephraim oracle, 17:1—11, is a microcosm of history, how
Damascus and Ephraim fare. They think they can be masters of
their own destiny through collective security, but who is the real
Ruler? Corresponding to this, 17:12 — 18:7 is a macrocosm of
history, the worldwide scale of things. The same question is
posed: who is the real Ruler?
1-3, Failed security. Damascus, the capital of Aram, comes
first as the prime mover in the ‘treaty organization’; Ephraim, the
northern kingdom of the people of God, is subsumed under
Damascus as having sunk itself in the alliance — in more senses
than one! (See 7:1-3; 2 Ki. 16:1-9.) The only known Aroer (Nu.
32:34) is in Gad, one of the constituent tribes of Ephraim. Thus
Isaiah allows his spotlight to swing back and forth three times in
these verses: once again the structure is the message. These powers have inextricably bound themselves together — and
together they will fall. Ephraim could have found security in the
Lord and, on the pattern of 16:5, could have sought to bring
Aram into the same security, but opted for the reverse course. Unbelieving Ephraim cannot be helped by Damascus, nor
Damascus by unbelieving Ephraim. Flocks: not a picture of
pastoral bliss but of a landscape emptied of humans and left to
the beasts. Like the glory is possibly ironic: the glory Ephraim
131
ISAIAH 17:4-8
might have enjoyed is doomed and Damascus with it. But more
likely the words are to be taken in their plain meaning: there is
something imperishable in Ephraim, a glory that guarantees a
future, but likewise there is a hope even for Aram. This unexpectedness of hope would be typically Isaianic and would,
incidentally, form an inclusio with the Gentile hope expressed in
he
4-11, Explanations: destruction and survival. The material in
these verses has been brought together as three Jn that day
oracles (4, 7, 9). The day in question is the time of the destruction
outlined in verses 1-3. 4-6. Three pictures of the extent of the destruction: a disease
which wastes the flesh away (4), reaping (Sa) and gleaning (5b).
The first picture touches the internal state of a patient: departure
from the way of faith means personal debilitation. The second
and third pictures bring external forces into play: reapers and
gleaners, between them, leave nothing behind. To depart from the
way of faith makes the people of God defenceless against
external forces of destruction, and leaves them with nothing to
show that they had ever been there. The survival of a few
ungleaned fruits (6) is humanly speaking against the odds — but
they are there, affirming a hope against hope that there will be
some survival. Just as the destruction threatened against the allied
powers (1-3) is underwritten by the divine title the LORD
Almighty (3), so the survival (6), against all probability, of some
is guaranteed by the title the God of Israel, the One who has
pledged himself to them.
Verses 7-8 describe the beneficial outcome of the divine
visitation. A spiritual purification will result: eyes will be fixed on
the Lord (7) and every human contrivance for salvation will be
abandoned (8).
_7. Men (ha’ adam): ‘humankind’. Isaiah seems to be thinking
wider than Israel, looking also to the ‘remnant of Aram’ (3).
Divine chastening brings spiritual benefit. Look is a fixed gaze (Sa‘a, 31:1; Ps. 119:117), making the Lord the sole object of confidence; the eyes are the organ of desire and expectation (Ps. 123:2), seeking all they need from his supply. Maker: a deliberate contrast to the hand-made gods of verse 8 (cf. Ps. 96:5). To the Holy One of Israel: it is costly to pride to turn to the true God. Gentiles coming in have to forswear national pride by acknow- ledging Israel’s God; Ephraim must repent of rebellion and schism and return to the Holy One who lives in Jerusalem (6:3). 8. Look ... regard are the same Hebrew verbs used in verse 7, and the two negative statements reinforce the message that
132
ISAIAH 17:9-10
turning to Holy One involves sole loyalty to him, the abandon- ment of every other god. Hands ... fingers implies that false
religion has this identifying mark: it is an exercise in human selfreliance. Along with the man-made gods goes their whole
religious support system: altars for sacrificial approach, Asherah
poles, i.e. symbolic representations of evergreens, standing for
the life and life-giving power of the goddess, and Baalistic
incense altars (Lv. 26:30; 2 Ch. 14:5), the means of communion with the god.
Verses 9-11 contain the explanation of the downfall. This is a
perfect example of the reasoned ministry the prophets offered.
They were not demagogues winning arguments by shouting
loudest; they offered description (9), diagnosis (10ab) and
prognosis (10b-11). Faith is ever the real test of the Lord’s
people: is it to be (lit.) ‘the cities of their stronghold’ (9) or ‘the
Rock of your stronghold’(10)?
9. The Hebrew, taken in order, reads ‘their strong cities will be
like the forsaken thing of forest and height which they left
because of the sons of Israel’. Doubtless the ruins of the longdeserted, overgrown fortresses of the pre-Israelite inhabitants of
Canaan were still visible. In Joshua’s time, trusting the Lord
proved stronger than ‘cities ... with walls up to the sky’ (Dt.
1:28), but when faith lapsed the people themselves built strongholds and trusted what they had once seen their God destroy.
10. Reinstate the initial ‘For’. In verses 10-11 the verbs are
second-person singular feminine, indicating that they did not
originally belong with verse 9. Most likely, the words were
originally addressed to a city as representing its people. But the
words are in place in their present context as an explanation of
the devastation: cities will fall (9); what could be more appropriate than an explanation addressed to a city? Forgotten ... not
remembered: the fixed gaze and longing eyes of verse 7 speak of
a God constantly in the forefront of mind and memory. Failure in
memory is the cause of spiritual disaster (Ps. 78:9-11, 40-42).
God your Saviour: literally ‘God of your salvation’. In this idiom
‘salvation’ is not an occasional act but a constant attribute: he is a
‘saving God’, and the possessive ‘your saving God’ means that
this attribute is ever available and active for his people. Rock is
more than a (static) symbol of changelessness. The use of the
metaphor in the Old Testament includes Exodus 17, the provident
rock from which the saving waters flowed. Fortress: specifically
a ‘strong place’, as also in verse 9 (‘strong’). It must have seemed
realism to build cities as ‘strong places’ in a threatening world; it
is ‘real realism’ to trust the Saving-Rock-God who is our ‘strong
133
ISAIAH 17:11—13
place’. Instead of this stability and security of faith, what did they
do? In their own estimation they built for security (9), but Isaiah
depicts them fiddling around with plants! What a futile thing is
human fortified security! What a silly thing is false religion! The
gardening metaphor (cf 1:29-31) is a reference to alien fertility
cults seen as a way to secure prosperity and living strength.
Imported: brought in from outside, like the alliance with
Damascus. ’
11. You comes four times. False religion is always a reflection
of human initiative (set them out ...) and has no vitality except
what the human devotee imparts (make them grow ...).
Many nations (17:12 — 18:7). The enlarged topic of this
second half of the oracle is announced at once: many nations. No
names are mentioned, for, as usual, Isaiah is not so much
interested in pinning events to dates as in seeing principles of
truth embodied in events. Yet it is not hard to read between the
lines and see the times of the Assyrian crisis: many nations in
turmoil (17:12), intense diplomatic activity (18:1), apparent
divine inactivity (18:4), the sudden end of the crisis (17:14).
Isaiah allows his vivid imagination and brilliant pen to go to
work on this scenario, and the result is a poem of immense power
embodying Isaiah’s distinctive view of the divine mastery of
history.
12-14, World rule in principle. The surging and roaring of the
nations (12) at the beginning stands in contrast to the dramatic
gone (14) at the end. Between these two points there is the single
Hebrew word he rebukes them (13).
12. Raging ... sea: the restless sea is an apt image of the flux
of world history seen through the human eye. In particular (Ps.
93) it is the world constituting a threat to the Lord’s throne and
people (cf 8:9-10; Ps. 2). As the kings of Assyria extended their
empire they created great conglomerate, multi-national armies;
on the other hand, the remaining nations, small and large, felt the
wind of the imperialist threat blowing. The Assyrian crisis
brought a particular time of surging, raging and threat. It will be
so on a global scale at the time of the Last Battle (13:1-5). 13. A single word of command rules the world (Pss. 2:4—6; 46:6; Ezk. 1:25); cf the same voice in relation to the ‘forces’ of creation (Ps. 104:7). In the context of this whole oracle, especially 17:1-11, what emerges is not only the sheer greatness of such a God but the folly of not trusting him. Chaff is both a picture of speedy and total dispersal and of swift judgment, before which its victims are helpless. The strength of the incoming tide (12), when he rebukes it (13), is nothing more than
134
ISAIAH 17:14 — 18:3
chaff and tumble-weed: seemingly irresistible in its coming, but helpless in its going!
14. Evening ... morning: cf. 37:36. Psalm 30:5 makes the
evening/morning theme speak about the characteristic way the
Lord works; Psalm 46:5, along with the present oracle, could
well be rooted in the Sennacherib incident. Sudden terror:
Sennacherib mesmerized Judah and Jerusalem with terror yet, come morning, was gone, literally ‘nothingness of him’/‘not a
sign of him!’ Us: whether on the ‘small’ scale of the single
incident of Sennacherib or on the implied macrocosm of nations
... peoples (12), it is all in the interests of us, the Lord’s people
(cf. 14:1-2). Again, how foolish not to trust him in every
emergency. There is not only his irresistible power in world rule
but his unfailing central concern for his people.
18:1—7, A signal to the world. In 715 BC the Ethiopian Piankhi
mastered Egypt and founded the twenty-fifth (Ethiopian)
Dynasty. He immediately sought to be a world statesman and
began sending envoys to create an anti-Assyrian conglomerate. In
17:1-3 Isaiah examined the smaller exercise in the collective
security of Aram and Ephraim. Here is a larger experiment on the
same lines, which Isaiah depicts in universal terms so as to test
out its validity as a possible answer to world needs. It failed in
the microcosm of 17:1ff. How will it fare on the macrocosm of
the world stage?
1. Woe is the same word as ‘Oh’ in 17:12, and should have the
same translation in order to bring out the balance between the
two sections: 17:12—14 asserts a principle of world government;
18:1 ff. tests it out in a world situation. Land of whirring wings:
Egypt with its profusion of flying insects. Isaiah does not name
Egypt but allows the whirring to suggest a busy, restless world.
Cush is the upper Nile region, Ethiopia. The whole impression
therefore is of the known world (Egypt) stretching out along its
great waterways to the remote and the unknown.
2. Envoys go out. Tall and smooth is usually interpreted as
referring to Ethiopians, a proverbially tall people in the ancient
world. But Vmdsak, ‘to draw out, prolong’, is never found
meaning ‘tall’. ‘Drawn out’ could mean ‘long-standing’ (Je.
31:3), ie. having a long record in history, and therefore wellestablished. Smooth (mérat) means polished, as of a sword
sharpened and gleaming, ready for action (Ezk. 21:9); maybe,
therefore, ‘in battle trim’, well-armed. This understanding makes
the people in question exactly the sort to seek out for an alliance.
3. We have already noticed (14:32; 16:4-5) how Isaiah can
step into diplomatic situations and give his own, perhaps
135
ISAIAH 18:4—7
unpopular, answer. This is what he does here. The mandate given
to Piankhi’s envoys would have been to win foreign courts to an
anti-Assyrian alliance, but their mission (2) now leads into
Isaiah’s worldwide message (3). We can picture the scene: the
envoys reach Jerusalem and Isaiah takes the opportunity to publicize what he would say to the whole world in the name of the
Lord. He would, in fact, send them on their way as his envoys.
He addresses the world (3ab); he calls for universal expectancy. A
banner (also 11:10) will be raised; a trumpet (also 27:13)
sounded — the combination of the visible and the audible suggesting that there will be every opportunity to be aware.
Thirdly, he appeals for a response: ‘Oh, do see ... hear!’ is more
suitable than the equally accurate you will see ...
4-7. An opening ‘For’ (omitted, NIV) introduces an explanation of Isaiah’s worldwide message. He has received a word
from the Lord (4a): the Lord waits (4b), chooses his moment (5)
when his harvest is ripe, the warring forces will be completely
destroyed (6) and there will be a worldwide pilgrimage to
Zion (7).
The Lord is the quiet (4) watcher in world affairs, present as
naturally as there is heat with light or dew in harvest. Yet he
remains the transcendent God, watching from my dwelling-place.
But as heat and dew are not just incidental to harvest but
contributory factors, so the Lord moves the whole process of
history toward its maturing.
Before the harvest (5): the harvest is ready, as the rest of the
verse indicates, but it has not yet been reaped. There is a
precision about the Lord’s timing. The crops are ripe for harvest
but the sickle will not be put in before his moment comes (Rev.
14:15). For the picture of the feasting birds (6), see Ezekiel
39:17-—29; Revelation 19:17—18.
Verse 7 speaks of the worldwide consummation. Time (‘ét) is
the ‘season’ appropriate for an event to happen. This picks up the
idea of the quietly watching, waiting Lord (4) and the striking of
his hour (5). Just as on the one hand (6) it will be the exactly right moment for universal judgment, the final collapse of human efforts to organize the world without God, so it will be exactly the right moment for the other sort of harvest: the Lord’s gathering in of a worldwide people. Gifts: specifically ‘homage gifts’ (Pss. 68:29; 76:11). Far and wide: see verse 2. There will be those from earth’s remotest bounds who have been alerted and waiting for the banner to be raised (3) and now they become pilgrims to Zion. The promise of a Gentile remnant was authenticated by the LORD Almighty (17:3). The same promise,
136
ISAIAH 19:1 — 20:6
es here in its visionary fulfilment, is authenticated by the same title.
v. Egypt: one world, one people, one God (Isaiah 19:1 —
20:6). This final oracle in the first series of five fits into the
sequence in two main ways. First, it follows logically from its
immediate predecessor. According to chapters 17 — 18, even
though Ephraim had sunk its identity in the world, it still retained
its glory (17:3) and therefore its hope (17:6), but, possibly even
more wonderfully, the Gentiles with whom they had identified to
their loss would, ‘in that day’, share the glory with them (17:4).
Isaiah then broadened this vision beyond Damascus to a people
coming to Zion from ‘far and wide’ (18:7). But on what terms do
they come? Isaiah replies in 19:24-25: one world, one people,
30) God. He proclaims the vision which Paul saw fulfilled (Eph.
Secondly, the series began with Babylon (13:1 — 14:27) linked
with Assyria as an interim fulfilment, and now it ends with
Egypt. Thus the contemporary superpower threat to the
continuance of the kingdoms of the people of the Lord is linked
with the first superpower threat: the Lord is sovereign over the
‘powers’ of earth and it is, in the end, his kingdom and not theirs
that triumphs. In the first oracle, the Mesopotamian powers of
Babylon and Assyria were associated as a major prediction (13:1
— 14:23) and its interim fulfilment; in this final oracle, the major
prediction focuses on Egypt (19:1—25) and it is followed by an
interim fulfilment (20:16), in which the two southern powers,
Egypt and Cush, are linked. The chapters fit equally snugly into
the history of the times. When the northern treaty powers, Aram
and Ephraim, were swallowed up by Assyria, the political centre
of gravity moved south. At least from 715 BC onwards Egypt was
ceaselessly active in fomenting anti-Assyrian feeling in the
remaining Palestinian states, and the possibility of recovering
national sovereign independence from Assyria by means of an
Egyptian alliance was a constant temptation to the politically
ambitious leaders of Judah (see chs. 28ff.). Isaiah resolutely
opposed this — holding to the truth he enunciated in the Ephraim
oracle (17:1—-11) that worldly alliance was a death warrant (cf
28:15). Consequently, the burden of 19:1—15 is to dissuade his
people from having anything to do with a people itself-destined to
collapse. It would have been strange indeed, in the light of
Egypt’s intriguing and Judah’s willingness to go along with it, if
Isaiah had not turned his formidable powers of diagnosis and
forecast on Egypt’s present and future. In 19:1-15 the smiting of
137
ISAIAH 19:1-4
Egypt is predicted, but this is followed by a vision of the healing
of Egypt and the bringing of even the threatening superpowers,
Egypt and Assyria, into a spiritual union and unity with Israel
(19:16-25). Then, by way of interim fulfilment — the imminent
experience guaranteeing the undated — the smiting of Egypt is
exemplified (20:1-6) in a particular historical event. — :
The smiting of Egypt predicted (19:1—-15). This passage is
full of statements of the Lord’s active opposition to Egypt, yet no
sins are specified to warrant such a divine onslaught. A clue is
found in Isaiah’s emphasis on the Nile-based economy of Egypt
(5-10), the claimed wisdom of Egypt’s rulers (11) and the use of
the verb give senseless advice (11, see below). Egypt is an
enlarged version of the Babel of Genesis 11:1—-9: human deter- mination to meet human needs, self-confident wisdom to solve
every problem without need of God. 1. Egypt is helpless before the Lord. Rides on a swift cloud:
the only other place where the divine Rider and the clouds appear
is Psalm 18:10-15, where the Lord swooped to rescue David
from Saul and set him on his throne. Now it is Egypt that is a
deadly threat to David’s kingdom (see on 28:14—15) and the Lord
is swift to react. Before him Egypt is demoralized. Jdols (’ “lilim):
the ‘no-gods’, non-entities, of 2:8. Tremble (ntia‘): ‘to wander’,
i.e. a are disorientated by the mere advent of the Lord. Melt:
seer 0:13:
2-4 speak of social collapse. The review covers relationships
(2), enterprise (3ab), religion (3cd) and government (4). The
general description of a divided society, Egyptian against
Egyptian (2), is spelled out in terms of family (2b), neighbourhood (2c), city (2d) and the reappearance of the old division
of Egypt into the two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt, north
against south. Divine action frustrates every effort Egyptians
make: nothing seems to work any longer (3ab) and (as ever) in
such a time religious cults flourish (3cd). Government decays
into dictatorship (4), the authoritarian solution to social collapse.
The fulfilment of this prediction could have been the rule of Piankhi himself (715 BC), Sargon’s conquest (cf 20:1-6), or Sennacherib, or the invasion of Egypt by Esarhaddon (680), Ashurbanipal (668) or Artaxerxes III Ochus (343). But much more important is the recognition that social problems arise from a spiritual root: the coming of the Lord in judgment (1) and his direct action in human affairs (2-4). Divisiveness (2) and ineffectiveness (3ab) are symptoms, not maladies. Those who flocked to the cults at least saw that a spiritual solution was needed even though their solution was in fact another symptom
138
ISAIAH 19:5—13
of the real problem. Faced with all this disintegration, why not try
force where appeal has failed (4)? If people will not do what they
ought to do, they will do what they are made to do! But this also
is a symptom, not the malady: the malady (1) is that they are not right with God.
5-10 describe economic collapse. The Nile, here mentioned
five times by name and four by synonym, was the basis of
Egypt’s economy. The drying up of the Nile (5-6) figures the
breakdown of the national economy. The riverbed (5): literally ‘a
river’, indefiniteness for the sake of emphasis, ‘the very River
itself’. Canals ... streams (6): the irrigation system which carried
Nile waters throughout the farmland of Egypt. River (7) should
be ‘Nile’: the name is sounded three times in one verse to
underline the enormity of the calamity. With the failure of the
water comes the failure of agriculture (sown field) and then
erosion (blow away). The fishing methods used here, hooks ...
nets (8), are depicted on Egyptian monuments. As the Nile dries
up, the fishing industry collapses. The rot extends to the
manufacturing sector (9). The production of flax and the
techniques of weaving were well advanced in Egypt. The
translation workers in cloth (10) is an emendation of the Hebrew
text, S“titeyha instead of Satoteyha, which means ‘pillars,
foundations’. The word is not used metaphorically elsewhere, but
if such a meaning is allowable here then the ‘pillars’ of the
economy are intended, the merchant venturers, the entrepreneurs,
the employers. When they fail, the wage earners might well
indeed become sick at heart. Once more, these problems might
be tackled as if they were the malady and not merely the
symptoms. But the symptom is not the malady. The Bible insists
that behind sound economy lies proper spirituality (Dt. 8:17-19;
cf. Haggai on inflation, 1:2-6).
11-13 move on to political collapse. In these verses wise
occurs three times, ‘princes’ (the civil service arm of government) appears twice as officials and once as leaders, and the
idea of ‘counsel’, noun and verb, three times. In a word, Isaiah
turns to the ‘Cabinet’ and the executive. Here folly reigns (13),
bewilderment (dizziness, 14), uncertainty (14cd) and helplessness
(15). For all their claims the leaders are unenlightened (11),
undiscerning (12) and misleading (13). So what should they do?
Change the government? But once more this is to deal with
symptom, not malady. Why are the leaders so foolish, undiscerning, efc.? Because the Lord has acted against them (14).
Once more the problem is spiritual.
Zoan (11) was situated in the north-eastern delta, and was
139
ISAIAH 19:14-18
effectively the capital of Egypt at the time of the Ethiopian
Dynasty. Fools (“wilim) are downright stupid people, unable
even to see the danger of their own actions (Ps. 107:17; Pr. je &
10:21). Give senseless advice: the word \ba‘ar means to live on
the level of animal thoughtlessness, unguided by true or higher
wisdom (Pss. 49:20; 73:22). In particular it means ‘to be without
spiritual discernment’, therefore it is linked here with their inability to see what the Lord is doing, that is, to discern a spiritual
cause behind national, social and economic problems. In the time
of Sennacherib’s invasion (701 BC) Egypt made its one and only
attempt to make good all its promises of aid. The Egyptian army
was routed by the Assyrians at El Tekeh, north of Ashdod. But
almost immediately, without human hand or aid, Sennacherib’s
power was broken (37:36-37). Egypt has the same chance as had Isaiah’s contemporaries to discern the spiritual behind the
historical. 14-15. The poem began with the Lord approaching Egypt;
now he is at work within the leaders. Dizziness: the word ‘iw‘im
occurs only here and means bewilderment or dithering. Stagger
(V‘awd): to deviate, i.e. now go this way, now that. All this is one
aspect of the holy judgment of the Lord (1 Ki. 22:21—23; 2 Thes.
2:11). Head ... or tail, palm branch or reed: see 9:14-15.
The healing of Egypt (19:16—25). Divine hostility is not the
last word. Alongside the world’s problem (1-15), Isaiah places
the Lord’s solution. He sets out a series of five in that day
statements. In his actions given in verses 1-15 the Lord has not
finished with Egypt. The Day will reveal other aspects of what he proposes to do.
16-17. First, he will instil the fear of the Lord. Isaiah foresees
an uplified hand, some unmistakable action of the Lord begetting
fear and terror as to what this awesome God is planning. They
do not yet know what his plan is, nor do they know that their fear
is the beginning of wisdom (Pr. 1:7). The LORD Almighty runs
like a link through this series (16, 18, 20, 25; cf 4, 12).
18 speaks of ‘one language and one Lord’. The details of this
second aspect of the Day are difficult to understand. What are the five cities? Why is one (or perhaps ‘each’) called the City of Destruction?’ Yet amid all the obscurity the central truth is plain:
ls ‘five’ meant to be five specific cities or does it simply mean ‘a few’ (17:6; 30:17)? Is Isaiah recalling the five cities taken in Joshua’s campaign (Jos. 10:22- 43), symbolic of total conquest? Isaiah is, of course, very capable of such an allusion, but it seems a trifle obscure. And is only one called the City of Destruction, or is one used here in its idiomatic sense of ‘each’ (e.g. Ex. 36:30)? Furthermore, destruction (MT heres), is not found elsewhere. Q* reads heres, ‘the
140
ISAIAH 19:19-22
following on the fear of the Lord (16) there will be a turning to
the Lord, marked by the adoption of the language of Canaan. It
would be typical of Isaiah to make speech the first mark of true
religion (6:5, 7; cf Jas. 1:26; 3:2). Language: literally ‘lip’,
looking back through Isaiah 6:5 to Genesis 11:1, where ‘the
whole earth was one lip’. Swear allegiance: their transformation
showed outwardly in speech, but inwardly it was also true.
19-22. What began in the five cities now embraces the whole
land from heart to border (19). There are five marks of true
religion: first an altar (19). The monument to the LORD at its
border signifies the place where the Lord dwells (cf. Gn. 28:16—
19) and marks his sphere of influence (Gn. 31:51—52) and the
land he claims as his own (1 Sa. 15:12, different word, same
idea). But at its centre would be an altar, a place of reconciliation
(6:6—7), and also a sign and witness (20), like the altar of Joshua
22:10, 23-27, that those who live where it is are truly part of the
people of the Lord.
Secondly, there is prayer (20). The people have a speaking
relationship with the Lord. Isaiah moves in thought from Joshua
22 to Judges 3:9: (cf 1 Sa. 12:10—11). Dangers are met and problems solved because they pray and the Lord responds. Thirdly,
there is revelation (21a). The Lord will make himself known. True
religion is not people searching after God but people responding
to revealed truth. Fourthly, there is worship (21b). This expresses
itself publicly in sacrifices and ... offerings and privately in vows.
True worship has two aspects: first there is our approach to God
through the means of grace he has provided: the sacrificial
system (cf Heb. 10:12—22); then there is our response to him in
the vowed dedication of ourselves (cf Rom. 12:1-2) and the
implementing of those vows in persistency of obedience. Fifthly,
there is providential discipline (22). Whom the Lord loves he
chastens (Pr. 3:12; Heb. 12:1-11); tribulation is a necessary
aspect of kingdom membership and final entrance (Acts 14:22);
every reception of the word of God is tested to prove its genuineness (Lk. 8:10—15; 1 Thes. 1:6). The purposeful discipline of
the Lord is part, then, of their life under his care, designed to
make them turn to the LORD, come back as penitents (cf 1:26),
look trustfully to him in prayer and receive his remedial care.
sun’. LXX, ‘the city of Asedeq’, may simply transliterate a Heb. (or supposed
Heb.) text hassedek, ‘of righteousness’. But why should such a well-known word
be transliterated rather than translated? The only thing that is certain in all this (to
us) obscurity is will be called (cf. 4:3; 61:6) — a new name indicating a new,
divinely implemented state.
141
ISAIAH 19:23-25
23 describes harmony in worship. First it was five cities (18),
then the whole land (19-22), and now the whole world. The
period of the Assyrian crisis was typical of world history. The
would-be imperialists, Assyria and Egypt, created a world of
tension, division, uncertainty and suffering. But where worldly
power divides, true religion based on revelation (cf 2:2-4)
unites. The emphasis in this fourth in that day oracle is the
harmony people feel with each other and the free expression they
give to it. Highway: what we would call a ‘causeway’, a raised
road, and therefore unmissable. The Egyptians and Assyrians will
worship together: this is the ground of their unity and what draws
them together. They accept each other because they have each
been accepted by the Lord (Rom. 14:1-3).
24-25 emphasizes again ‘one people, one world, one Lord’. In
the first in that day (16), Judah was part of the fear Egypt felt.
This is proper, for true acknowledgment of the Lord involves
acknowledgment of and submission to those who are already his
people (1 Cor. 14:24-25). But the convert at once enjoys perfect
acceptance by the Lord (my ... my ... my ...) and co-equal
membership in and with all who are his. The titles people,
handiwork and inheritance always belonged to Israel (2 Sa. 3:18;
Is. 29:22—23; Ps. 28:9). In Egypt, at the exodus time, the Lord
drew a distinction when he said, ‘Let my people go’ (Ex. 5:1), but
now Egypt is my people!
The smiting of Egypt exemplified: an interim fulfilment
(20:1—6). For four years Egypt had been busy fomenting antiAssyrian rebellion in the Palestinian states, promising Egyptian
aid once the flag of rebellion was raised. In 713 BC Ashdod
obliged, and in 711 Assyria struck back. The king of Ashdod was
replaced by a puppet. The rebellion, however, continued. The
new king was driven out and, with Egypt still in the background,
envoys were sent to Judah, Edom and Moab to rally them to the
cause. Since Hezekiah suffered no Assyrian reprisals, it is
probable that he held aloof. But Ashdod did not escape. Sargon
king of Assyria sent his supreme commander (1) and Ashdod became an Assyrian province. True to form, Egypt then reneged on its promises.
At some time in all this, Isaiah performed an acted oracle by going about stripped and barefoot (2). His intention was to mime the fate of those taken captive by Assyria and thus to expose the folly of trusting Egypt. He committed himself visibly to the veracity of the word he had received from the Lord. The narrative is included here as an interim fulfilment. Isaiah has outlined a world hope (19:24—25), in which three nations of his own day
142
ISAIAH 20:1-6
figured: his own people, the imperial Assyria and the would-be
imperial Egypt. His vision was that these three would become
one people under one God. If this sounded incredible, then his
contemporaries observe how the word of the Lord is fulfilled in
the outworking of world events, even when superpowers are involved.
1. In the year: i.e. 711 BC. Supreme commander (tartan): the
second in command to the king (2 Ki. 18:17), in this case Sargon
II (722-705), one of the greatest of the kings of Assyria.
2. At that time (‘ét) is not a precise dating but refers to
whatever moment was opportune for such a message. Sackcloth
was apparently Isaiah’s normal wear, whether it signifies the
sackcloth of mourning (15:3) or the rough clothing adopted by
prophets (2 Ki. 1:8). Stripped: ‘arém means ‘naked’. Maybe NIV
is correct in seeking to safeguard the proprieties by an interpretative translation, but it is not the general use of the word.
Captives were often stripped (4; 47:2-3). Isaiah paid the price of
obedient identification with the word of the Lord. The prophets
frequently accompanied their spoken word with visible demonstrations of the truth (e.g. Je. 13:1 ff.; 19:1-13; Ezk. 5, 12). The
purpose included that of a ‘visual aid’ but went further, for the
word of God was expressed in a double way: by speech and b
act. Its fulfilment was thus doubly secured (see 2 Ki. 13:14-19).
3. For three years the people had watched Isaiah, wondering
what his behaviour portended. Was he just telling them that
rebels against Assyria would not succeed? But, as we might say,
any fool could have forecast that Ashdod would not stand a
chance! Perhaps the wiseacres were mocking, saying, ‘Tell us
something we don’t know!’ In fact that is precisely what he was
doing. The message was not what they expected to hear, nor what
the sophisticated politicians of Jerusalem wanted to hear, enamoured as they were with Egypt and its promises. The captives in
question would be Egyptian and Cushite (the two linked together
because the Ethiopian dynasty was in power). 4. Isaiah did not say Egypt/Cush would be conquered but only
that Judahites would see sad strings of captives being deported.
This would have happened certainly after the battle of El Tekeh
(701 Bc), Egypt’s one — and failed — attempt to honour its
promises. Since this took place in that year before Sennacherib’s
assault on Judah, it could well have contributed to Hezekiah’s
bleak despondency (37:1-4), just as Isaiah said it would. Egypt's
shame is (lit.) ‘Egypt’s nakedness’, the state of the captives
exposing the bankrupt state of the nation itself.
5-6. Put to shame: the embarrassment of having laid plans
143
ISAIAH 21:1-10
that fell through, trusted promises that were not kept, entertained
hopes which were reversed. On this coast: the captives would be
led back to Assyria along the coast roads. Those who lived there
would be the first to see before their very eyes what folly it is to
trust Egypt, and the first, therefore, to conclude that some other
object of trust must be sought against Assyria.
b. The second series of oracles: the long night and the dawn
(21-23)
See the introduction to chapters 13 — 27, pp. 110-112. The first
series of oracles (13 — 20) was marked by buoyant optimism.
Even the world’s superpowers are subject to the word of the Lord
and his word is full of glorious promise. This second series is
very different. Even though the content of each oracle makes its
subject plain, the oracles have enigmatic titles, giving an air of
mystery, even of foreboding, to the whole. There is, in fact, a
pervasive sense of doom and darkness.
The series begins with a vision of such horror that Isaiah recoils from it (21:1—10); this is followed by a voice calling out of
darkness and being promised more darkness (21:11—12); then
come Arabian tribes in the desert without necessary supplies
(21:13-17), followed by Jerusalem committing the unforgivable
sin (22:14). The light at the end of the tunnel is the oracle on Tyre
(23:18) where age-long materialism becomes sharing and outright worldliness becomes holiness to the Lord. It was suggested
above (p. 111) that the enigmatic titles are Isaiah’s way of
showing that he has left the sharp clarity of his contemporary
scene and is looking into the future. If so, history is not a tale of
everything getting better and better. Rather, divine judgments
become starker, problems remain unsolved and the people of God
live below their dignity. Yet even so, darkness is streaked by the light of dawn.
i. The desert by the sea: the Babylon principle (21:1-10).
According to verse 9, this first oracle predicts the fall of Babylon.
But which fall? The one which most readily matches the terms of Isaiah’s vision is the overthrow of the city by Sennacherib in 689 BC. This certainly matched the vision’s ferocity, for Sennacherib records that he filled the city with corpses and, as for ‘the gods dwelling therein, the hands of my people took them and smashed them’. Buildings were razed and, as a final gesture, ‘huge vol- umes of water (were) released over the ruins’.!
' See Erlandsson, The Burden of Babylon, p. 91, for full discussion and cogent
144
ISAIAH 21:1-10
Such violence has a logic to it, even if it is horrific. Babylon
had been the most unruly element in Assyria’s empire. Twice (in
the years 722-710 BC and then 705-702) Merodach-Baladan had
led Babylon into independence from Assyria and was even a
threat to Assyrian dominance in Mesopotamia. As we shall see in
chapter 38, he included Judah in his attempt to foment unrest.
The present oracle could be Isaiah’s attempt to dissuade Judah
from joining Babylon in an anti-Assyrian alliance. It plays the
same role in relation to Merodach-Baladan and Babylon as 19:1—
15 does in relation to an Egyptian alliance. Who would want to
turn for strength to the doomed?
The poetry is as highly charged as anything Isaiah ever wrote,
but, because it is poetry, ‘reading between the lines’ is necessary. The prophet sees a picture of whirlwind after whirlwind
sweeping the Negeb by the Dead Sea (1) and it speaks to him of
incoming danger (1); he overhears, as it were, what MerodachBaladan’s envoys say to Hezekiah: Assyria is as deceitful as ever
(2b), but Elam and Media are ready to take up arms and put a
stop to all the suffering Assyria has caused (2cd). Isaiah returns
to his own sense of foreboding (3, 4). He had naturally longed to
see the twilight of Assyrian power (4c), but the vision is so dire
that it becomes pain and grief to him (3). Then he hears other
voices (5), evidently coming from the palace where they are
laying on a banquet to celebrate their treaty with Babylon (Sa-c)
and confidently calling the military to take up the struggle (Sde).
But why is Isaiah so stricken? He now lets us into the secret
revealed to him (6a): were he to set a lookout he would in due
time report the fall of Babylon and the collapse of its gods in ruin
(6b-9). And this is the message he must bring to the Lord’s
people: crushed as Judah is under Assyria (10a), what solution is
it to link itself with the doomed Babylon? — and this is a word
from the Lord (10bcd). But if the oracle can be seen as addressed to the circumstances
that prevailed in or around 705 BC, why does not Isaiah entitle it
with reference to Merodach-Baladan? Why the cryptic concerning the Desert by the Sea (1)? Because, though he originally
spoke the oracle with reference to the embassy recorded in
39:1ff., his purpose here is broader: he ‘seems to draw upon these
events in order to portray the imminent fall of the world city, the
onset of the woes of the final age which precedes salvation.’' In
argument for seeing this as the Assyrian destruction of Babylon in 689 BC, not the
Persian capture in 539 BC. :
1 See O. Kaiser, Isaiah 13 — 39 (SCM, 1974), p. 128. Kaiser, however, relates
145
ISAIAH 21:1—2
the scheme of these oracles, the actual Babylon (13:1) becomes
the city behind the cryptic title (21:1) and finally the ‘ruined city
of 24:10, the horror resulting from the human attempt to organize
the world without God. As Isaiah probes forward he sees that
there will always be a Babylon principle operating in world
history: humankind’s attempt (as in Gn. 11:1—9) to impose order
and unity on the world and to create its own security. World order
without God is a doomed endeavour.
The oracle has an Al-B1-C-B2-A2 structure.
1-2a. Isaiah receives a vision (Al). The most likely first
explanation of the enigmatic title concerning the Desert by the
Sea' is that this was where Isaiah received it. Would it be too
‘ordinary’ to think that he had taken his family on holiday and
came back reporting that the weather had been dreadful, one
storm after another? But as he recalled these successive
whirlwinds, they spoke to him of ‘something coming from the
desert’. NIV interpretatively adds an invader, but Isaiah wrote
only ‘it comes’ — all the more ominous for being left unnamed
and because it came ‘from the desert ... a land of terror’ (Dt.
8:15). 2b-d (Bl). The traitor ...: ‘The betrayer betrays and the
destroyer destroys’ was originally a reference to Assyria (see on
33:1) and therefore a suitable ploy to be used by MerodachBaladan’s emissaries: Assyria will never change; we have to do
something about it. In its present context, loosened from its
original setting, it refers to the breakdown of values in the world:
people are not be trusted, property is not respected. Elam: if the
oracle is interpreted as referring to the fall of Babylon to the
Medes and Persians in 539 BC, this reference to Elam is
inexplicable, for Elam ceased to be a significant power in the
latter years of the seventh century. But at the time of MerodachBaladan, a call to Elam and Media to take up arms would create a
strong pawn in the diplomatic game. Behind the imperatives we
can hear the boast of the ambassadors that all they have to do is
say the word and Elam and Media will take up arms. J will bring:
Merodach-Baladan saw himself as the answer to the Assyrian Oppression in his day; now the words represent the imagined
vv. 1-10 to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC. We need to ask how the bloodless capture of Babylon by Cyrus could be represented as this ‘dire vision’ and why it should be a grim, joyless duty for Isaiah to convey such news to his people. : Erlandsson suggests that the Desert by the Sea could be the Hebrew equivalent to mat tamtim (‘the land of the sea’), the area round the Persian Gulf, i.e. Merodach-Baladan’s habitat. This would be a link between the oracle and its point of origin.
146
ISAIAH 21:3-9
voice of a long line of would-be deliverers. Just as there will
always be dominant powers in world history, so there will be
those confident of overthrowing them.
3-5 (C). At this (3): i.e. ‘Therefore’. Isaiah’s reaction is one of
horror, physically (3) and emotionally (4ab). There is a twilight
he longed for but, seeing it in its full awfulness, it has become a
horror. By contrast (5), there are those who see it all as an
opportunity for a party (Sa—c) and think nothing of initiating
military action (Sde). First, then, in the context of MerodachBaladan’s embassy (705 BC; 39:1), the twilight is the longed-for
eclipsing of Assyrian power, but Isaiah knows the frightful
consequences of Babylon enduring such a savage overthrow but
even more for the Lord’s people if they seek to bring it about by
joining a worldly alliance. But Hezekiah fell easily for the
ambassadors’ blandishments (39:1-2), welcoming them and
laying on a banquet to celebrate, with after-dinner speakers
braying confidently about the rightness of their cause. Oil the
shields: i.e. anoint them as for a holy war. To Isaiah all this was
agonizing. Would it mean deliverance for Judah? No, because
Babylon itself was doomed (9). But in the meantime they would
have to endure the savage onslaught of Sennacherib. The price of
an Assyrian eclipse would be far too high!
Secondly, however, as we have noted, the enigmatic titles of
this second series of oracles show Isaiah looking forward beyond
his own day. There will always be some superpower seeking to
dominate the world; always, too, confident deliverers looking for
allies; always a professing people of the Lord gratuitously
throwing themselves into the conflict to their own suffering and
loss; and then, at the Day itself, the ultimate horror of the Lord’s
final dealing with sin and sinners, and with the world system
which embodies human pride, the spiritual Babylon of Revelation
18-19. 6-9 (B2). In order to bring home the certainty of Babylonian
downfall, Isaiah pictures a Jookout told what to watch for (7),
faithful in his duty (8), seeing the predicted event fulfilled (Qab)
and sharing the news which has thus been brought to him (9c—f).
Chariots ... horses ... donkeys ...camels (Jab): literally ‘a
mounted troop, pairs of horses, a mounted troop on donkeys, a
mounted troop on camels’. M. S. Seale notes that ‘Arabian
nomads, preparing to go into battle, rode one mount ... and
trailed another.’ Cf 2 Kings 9:25, which Seale translates ‘You
and I were riding pairs’.' Seale says the second beast was held in

147
ISAIAH 21: 10
reserve as a fresh mount should flight become necessary. The
watchman, therefore, is to look out for troops going into battle.
The lookout shouted (8): literally ‘A lion shouted’, i.e. ‘And lion
that he is, he shouted’, that is, a man of resolute strength, reliable
in discharging the task given to him. The watchman is, of course,
the prophet, and the verses give an insight into the demands of
the prophetic office: resolute to declare only what he saw (6),
intrinsic reliability of character (7), disciplined to wait until he
has a sure message to declare (8). Look, here comes ... (9): ‘And, oh look! — Here comes a mounted troop of men, pairs of horses.’
Since they are still riding one horse and trailing another, they
return as victors. Indeed so, for Babylon has failed and its
ideology (all its gods) with it. 10 (A2). Picking up the verb fel] from verse 2a (‘shown’),
Isaiah rounds the poem off. He saw a ‘dire vision’ and now he
has reported it as a message from the LORD. Therefore, in the
oracle’s original setting, let Hezekiah be warned: Babylon may
be plausible, but to identify his future with it is to share its doom.
It is to go the way of the original Babylon, Shinar (Gn. 11:1-—9):
the epitome of the spirit of human self-sufficiency. And, of
course, as history moves beyond what Isaiah sees around him, the
same is repeated, the same principles operate and the same
temptations beset the people of God. It is not easy to maintain a
position of faith, especially in times of stress and suffering,
crushed on the threshing fioor. It is so easy to opt for anything
that offers promise of release. But faith sees differently. We are
still my people; we are (lit.) ‘my crushed one, son of my
threshing floor’; the crushing pressures of life come from the
Lord; the blows are his blows, purposely designed to bring the
crop safely into the granary. The Almighty power that lies behind
all history is that of the LoRD, Yahweh, who is not only the Judge
of those who disobey but the redeemer, the God of Israel — not
the God we chose but who chose us and who will never go back on his choice.
ii, Silence: days of darkness (21:11-12). Passages like 2 Kings 8:7ff. show that prophets were approached by people of other nations. It could well be that in the frenzied diplomatic activity prompted by the Assyrian threat Edomites came to Jerusalem and one sought out Isaiah for counsel. We cannot know whether this was so or whether Isaiah was privately meditating on the agony Edom too was suffering under Assyria. Sargon campaigned there in 715 BC. But we feel the poignancy of a lone voice in the darkness and of the exchange with the
148
ISAIAH 21:11-15
prophet: ‘What can you tell me? I can tell you nothing. Will
things change? No, they will not. Even if morning comes, night
comes fast behind it.’ In its setting in the matching pentad of
oracles, this corresponds to the Philistine oracle in 14:28-32. The
Philistines mistook the signs of the times and thought David’s
dynasty was defunct. They needed to be made aware of a coming,
mightier fruit from David’s root. But, in response to the Edomite
cry, Isaiah warns that the true dawn is in the undated future and
in the meantime darkness predominates. The watchman of verse
6 is still watching; the crushing of verse 10 is still unhealed.
Things go on as they have always done (2 Pet. 3:4), yet it is
always worthwhile to ask how much of the night is left, for
darkness will not have the last word (Rom. 13:11-12). Thus a
solitary Gentile mirrors world history: the end will come; the end
is not yet. Hope lies in the future (12ab) and though it is deferred
it is sure (12cd).
11-12. Dumah (11a) means ‘silence’ (Pss. 94:17; 115:17), and,
since the questioner came from Seir, doubtless Isaiah meant
Dumah both to hint at Edom and also to reflect the silence of his
reply regarding the future. The Lord’s programme is carried
forward not only in great, dramatic events (9) but also in the
regular forward moving of time (12), in huge periods when
nothing seems to be happening at all. Isaiah imposed on his
enquirer the hardest discipline of all, the discipline of sticking it
out. Js coming is a Hebrew perfect of certainty: ‘is sure to come,
has been ordained to come’. Come back: though the process is
protracted, the end is certain.
iii. Desert evening: Gentile needs unsolved (21:13—17). This
third oracle corresponds to the crisis in which the Gentile Moab
found itself (15-16). Moab could have turned to Zion for safety
but was held back by pride. The Arabian tribes of the desert are
in straits: can they solve their problem by mutual succour? No,
their need remains unmet. Once more the historical background is the Assyrian crisis. In
715 BC Sargon campaigned against tribes living between Tema
(an oasis city far south of Elath and east of the Red Sea) and the
Gulf of Aqaba; in 703 Arabs joined Merodach-Baladan in
rebellion and were crushed by Sennacherib. Isaiah depicts the
Arabian tribe of the Dedanites fleeing from the war and Tema is
urged to succour them. The Gentile world in its need seeks to be
self-sufficient in mutual aid. The interim fulfilment (16-17) puts
paid to any hope that collective security will save it.
13-15. An oracle concerning Arabia: uniquely in this series of
149
ISAIAH 21:16-17
oracles, the preposition (concerning) is b°, meaning “in, against’;
Arabia is literally ‘Arabs’. The whole is as allusive as the
previous two titles (1, 11). The consonants b‘rb could just as
easily mean ‘in the evening’ as ‘in/against Arabs’ — both in the
title and in 13c. ‘Evening’ could prompt the same foreboding as
‘twilight’ (4c). This cannot be called a sure interpretation but it
suits the cryptic titles characteristic of this series and the place of
this oracle in context, Gentiles in a darkening world. Dedanites:
NIV understands the Dedanites as receiving a command to bring
water (14), but in order to justify this understanding it must
change the Hebrew indicative tense (‘they bring’) to an imperative. According to the Hebrew, however, the Dedanites are
obliged to camp in the thickets, the scrub, off the beaten track. Of
Arabia is b‘rb as above: dare we combine the two possible meanings of these consonants as ‘in Arab-eventide’?
The people of Zema (14) bring supplies to the fugitives,
literally ‘To meet the thirsty, they bring water; those who live in
the land of Tema with his bread (the bread he needed) were there
to meet the fugitive.’ The same word for fugitives occurs in 16:2—
3 of Moabites fleeing from danger. They could have fled to Zion
but the Arabian tribes seek to be self-sufficient.
The explanation of all this (15 begins with ‘For’) is that the
fugitives had been caught up in the actuality of war: ‘swords’
(lit., plural) suggests being caught between two opposing forces —
the grim situation of those whose land becomes the battle-arena
for others. The restless world has caught them in its grip: where
can they find assistance? Will the aid offered by Tema solve the problem?
16-17. This concluding statement begins with a sovereign
word (16, what the LorD [here ’“donday] says [‘has said’] to me)
telling of an imminent end (within one year), shattering Kedar’s
power (17, few). This is assured because the LORD, the God of
Israel, has spoken. The distressed Dedanites and their helpers of
Tema sought to master their world by their own resources. But
the thing which brackets the world is the word of the Sovereign,
the God of Israel (16a, 17b). It is he who will not allow humankind to be self-sufficient and to make their world their own. The parallel oracle on Moab contained, like this one, an interim fulfilment (16:14), and both contain the words as a servant bound by contract (16), ‘glory’ (here pomp; in 16:14, ‘splendour’) and ‘remnant’ (16:14 and here, survivors). This identity of wording as well as themes bind the oracles together: the Gentile world is in straits, the good news of salvation in Zion is refused, and the sovereign Lord will not allow them to achieve
150
ISAIAH 22: 1-25
their own security. Kedar: a general title for the Arabian area with its nomadic tribes.
iv. The Valley of Vision: the unforgivable sin (22:1—25).
Once more the people of God occupy the fourth place in the
series of oracles (cf pp. 110-112, 130; 17:1 — 18:7), but now the
actual Jerusalem, which provides the content of verses 1-14 and
the setting for 15-25, is shrouded under the enigmatic title the
Valley of Vision. We are thus alerted to the fact that this oracle too
operates on two levels: the factual level of reasonably datable
events, and the visionary level of principles which those events
eae and which will continue to operate in the undated
ture.
At first sight the oracle is a strange mixture of the national (1—
14) and the personal (15-25), the city (1-14) and the individual
(15-19, 20-25), and it would be easy to question the appropriateness here of addresses about Shebna (15-19) and Eliakim
(20-25), not least because no other oracles in chapters 13 — 27
concern themselves with named individuals.’ Closer examination
is illuminating. The charge laid at the door of Jerusalem is the
choice of self-sufficiency. The key verses (8b-11) tell how in
their crisis the Jerusalem people relied on their arsenal (8b),
cannibalized the city to strengthen the walls (10) and secured a
safe water-supply (9b, 11). Shebna is revealed as an important
official in whom the spirit of self-reliance is incarnate: he is a
man who can take care of his present repute (18d) and provide
for his continuing glory (16). In a different way Eliakim (20-25)
would be caught in the same trap if he should come to see
himself and allow himself to be seen as the chief support of
others, the indispensable man (see below on 23-25). In a word,
the ‘story-line’ of the whole oracle is the question, Where is
security found? In Isaiah’s teaching, when city (1-14), individual
(15-19) and family (20-25) become self-sufficient, they have
committed the unforgivable sin.
1 The switch from 3rd person (16-18) to Ist person (19-23a) can be
accounted for by thinking in terms of Isaiah’s ‘mosaic’ method, taking tesserae
from different points in his ministry and fitting them together into a fresh
integration. Verse 19 can be viewed as an editorial bridge, summarizing what has
preceded and making the switch to Ist person in preparation for vv. 20-23.
Internally vv. 15—25 are bracketed by what the Lord, the LORD Almighty says (15)
and declares the LORD Almighty ... The LORD has spoken (25). The word to
Shebna, you disgrace to your master’s house (18), is balanced by Eliakim
possibly becoming honour for the house of his father (23). See D. Stacey, Isaiah
1 — 39 (Epworth, 1993) and Miscall, Isaiah, ad loc.
151
ISAIAH 22:la
The self-sufficient city (22:1-14). A number of historical
occasions are suggested for this passage. The roof-top joy (1-2)
is possibly popular reaction to the end of the Assyrian threat as
recorded in 2 Kings 19:35-36.' This has a nice simplicity about it
but it does not wholly fit the oracle: first, Isaiah would hardly
have been offended by an outburst of joy occasioned by a divine
act of deliverance — even if he thought it hollow — and why, on such an occasion, would the Lord have summoned his people to lamentation (12)? In addition, there is no record of leaders
deserting (3a) under Sennacherib’s pressures. Another view’ is that Isaiah is addressing the moment when Sennacherib accepted Hezekiah’s gold (2 Ki. 18:16) and lifted the threat. Jollity over
such a deliverance would not have met with the prophet’s approval, glorying as it did in human resources and diplomacy.
But once more, though the suggestion is broadly suitable, the details do not fit. It is unlikely that Jerusalem was under a suf- ficiently long threat at this time for the rigour of siege conditions
to have bitten (2b); again, there is no record of leadership
defection (3); and, furthermore, how could the Assyrian forces be represented by Elam (6) since throughout this period Elam was
Babylon’s ally against Assyria? It is simplest to note that the facts
of verses 2c—3 are linked to the fall of Jerusalem to Babylon in
586 BC by the flight of the leaders (2 Ki. 25:4). In light of this the verbs in verses 2—3 must be understood as ‘perfects of certainty’
(see below). The passage begins with a contrast between present
joy (1-2a) and coming calamity (2b—4), a ‘day of the Lord’ (5—7). There was a crucial moment when, sensing their vulnerability
(8a), choices were made regarding security (8b—11) and, feeling
that they had made themselves invulnerable in armaments (8bc), fortifications (9ab, 10ab) and water-supply (9cd, 11), they
resorted to joy in defiance of a divine call to penitence (12-13).
This cannot be forgiven (14).
1a. The Valley of Vision: Isaiah does not explain why he chose
this enigmatic title. Jerusalem itself was not a valley. He could, of
course, have been walking through some valley when the vision was borne in upon him but, whether this was so or not, the grimness of the vision and the intensity of his awareness of the
' Clements, Isaiah 1 — 39, pp. 182ff.; O. Kaiser, Isaiah 13 — 39, pp. 136ff. Both these commentators suggest highly complex reconstructions which, we need to remember, are not based on manuscriptal or other objective evidence, but are aprenpbaactl exercise attempting to solve problems which they find inherent in the text.

152
ISAIAH 22:1b-7
divine word (14a) suggest a dark valley of the soul (Ps. 23:4).
Jerusalem/Zion was more than the locus of Isaiah’s ministry; it
was the focal point of his expectations (e.g. 2:2-4; 25:6-9; 26:1-
4; 33:20-24; 40:9; 54:1ff.; 62:1ff.; 66:10—-13). It would have
brought the profoundest ‘dark night of the soul’ to him to foresee its coming desolation.
1b-2b. What troubles you is a strange translation for an
address to jubilant, carefree (2ab) people! The literal ‘What to
you?’ is a formula of repudiation (Je. 2:18; Ho. 14:8), ‘What
business have you ...?’ or ‘What do you mean by ...?’ It implies
that this course of action cannot be justified (cf 52:5). Just as
roof tops were places of communal lament (15:3), so also of
communal festivity. Commotion (t°su’6t): literally ‘hubbub’ (Jb.
39:7), the noise (Zc. 4:7) of an excited crowd. Tumult (Nhamé):
of happy excitement (as in 1 Ki. 1:40-41).
2c—4. Isaiah now explains why he has questioned their joy. He
sees a different scene (2c—3), meriting inconsolable sorrow (4).
Regarding the verbs in verse 3 we need to bear in mind that, in
Hebrew, ‘tenses’ represent types rather than times of action. The
‘perfect tense’ (used here) stands for certainty or completedness
and can therefore refer to the past (an action already completed),
or the present (action ‘this day’, done decisively) or the future (an
action so settled that its certainty can be assumed). Thus the
prophet foresees as certain that there will be people dead without
a fight (2cd), without using the bow (3), as in siege conditions,
and leaders deserting the doomed city (3; 2 Ki. 25:4). Having fled
... : NIV interpretatively adds while the enemy was. The Hebrew is
simply ‘they fled far away’, the deserting leaders putting as much
distance between themselves and danger as possible. Therefore
arises from the contrast between the cheery complacency of the
people and the dark vision of the prophet. He wants nothing of
their curiosity (Turn away) nor of their sympathy (console). Of
my people: literally ‘of the daughter of my people’. This
synonym for Jerusalem is found only here in Isaiah (cf Je. 8:19).
It is full of feeling for the city, as for a beloved daughter at the
mercy of the merciless. 5-7. Having explained his isolation in sorrow (4), Isaiah now
explains the dark vision: verse 5 begins with ‘For’ and looks back
to 2c—3. Behind the catastrophe lies the purpose of a just and holy
God. What looms is a day of the Lord (5a), expressed in
destruction of the city (5), implemented by Elam (6) and
inescapable (7). On the dovetailing agencies of the Lord (Sa) and
Elam (6a) see 10:5-15. In verse 5, the Lord (’“dondy, the Sovereign One), the LORD
153
ISAIAH 22:8-14
(Yahweh) is the God who made himself uniquely known to Israel
and who will exact much from those to whom much was given
(Am. 3:1-2). Almighty (‘of hosts’) is the One who is and has
every potentiality and power. Has a day: cf 2:12. The day is
already fully prepared, awaiting his moment to insert it on the
time-line of Israel’s experience. This is the Old Testament view
of time and history as part of the Lord’s covenantal arrangements
(Je. 33:20). Tumult (Vhamd, see 2) is the uproar of the day;
trampling, the violence and cruelty of it; terror (Mi. 7:4; cf, EX.
14:3; Joel 1:18; Est. 3:15), the consequent disorientation of those under attack. And finally, the desperate human suffering
inseparable from the sack of the city: crying (from Vsawa‘, ‘to
cry out for help’), their screams resounding out to the encircling
mountains. Elam (6), to the west of Babylon, was, throughout Isaiah’s
period, allied with Babylon against Assyria. Kir: of unknown
location (Am. 1:5; 9:7; not the Moabite city of 15:1). Takes ...
uncovers are perfects of certainty (see 3). The quiver is part of
the armour of attack; the shield, of defence. In between come the
mobile forces, charioteers ... horses. The intention is to build up
a picture of military prowess from which there can be no escape:
the valleys (7) which might offer concealment for flight are
occupied, and the gates under constant observation. To face the
horrible reality of all this as a day (5) of the Lord raises questions
for every sensitive spirit. Can this be true of the Lord? Would he
so do? These questions are logical and unavoidable — but a
negative answer would not be truly biblical. The men of
Bethshemish (1 Sa. 6) faced the loss of life consequent on the
temerity of ‘looking at’ the ark of the Lord, but they did not query
the propriety of divine righteous judgment — even so condign a
judgment on so seemingly small a fault. They did not ask ‘Why?’
They trembled before the Holy One: ‘Who can stand in the
presence of the LORD, this Holy God?’ (1 Sa. 6:20). Our doubts
are the products of an inadequate sense of what holiness is and a
limited understanding of the fact that the wages of sin is death, a
pi indeed, but one whose application makes us look for get-out clauses. Verses 8-14 fall into two contrasting parts, marked by in that day (8b, 12), referring back to 8a. Sensing itself to be defenceless (8a) the nation focused on armaments (8bc), fortifications and water-supply (9—-1lab). Note how Isaiah moves from walls (9ab) to water (9cd) and then back again (10-11), emphasizing not only where they considered their security lay but their busy deter- mination to see the work done. Verses 8 and 11 balance each
154
ISAIAH 22:8-11
other: you looked ... you did not look. In verses 12-14 Isaiah
turns from popular reaction to the Lord’s reaction. He saw the
solution to the danger (8a) in spiritual terms, lamentation and
penitence (12), but so delighted were they in their do-it-yourself
security that a public holiday was declared (13). But to ignore the
Lord, refuse the way of penitence and faith, and embark on the
road to self-salvation, constitute the unforgivable sin (14).
8. The defences ... are stripped is an acceptable translation but
the literal is better: ‘He removed Judah’s protective cover.’ The
onset of Sennacherib exposed Judah’s vulnerability — in spite of
all the alliances and preparations that had preceded it. Hezekiah
summed it all up in two words, ‘no strength’ (37:1-3). But behind
the event was the Lord’s purpose to test whether, under
Hezekiah’s leadership, they would go the way of faith or the way
of the world (Dt. 8:2-5). 2 Chronicles 32:1-8 is a very apt
comment on this point: military solutions before prayer and trust.
9-11. The details of Jerusalem’s water-supply are obscure.
The source was the Gihon Spring to the east. At an early stage
this was linked to a shaft inside the city (2 Sa. 5:6—-8); at a later
date there was an overground conduit (7:3) supplying what Isaiah
calls the Old Pool. It was the exposed nature of this channel that
made Ahaz panic, for it meant that a city virtually impregnable
by virtue of its position could be ‘dried out’ by cutting off the
Gihon waters. Hezekiah, however, showed remarkable initiative
and extraordinary engineering skill by driving his tunnel from the
spring into the city (2 Ki. 20:20; 2 Ch. 32:2-4). The reservoir
was probably fed by the tunnel and could be the same as the
Lower Pool (9). The king also built walls. The two walls (11)
might be an area created by a new wall running outside the
existing wall of David’s city. But this colossal achievement — the
tunnel — and the sacrifices made to secure the walls (10) simply
add up to the unforgivable sin (14), manifesting as they do
humankind’s determined omnicompetence and self-sufficiency.
After all, why bother with faith when we have walls and water!
Why look (11) to the Lord when we can look to ourselves! But
made it ... planned it long ago tell a different story. Jerusalem
was the Lord’s chosen city (Dt. 12:5; 1 Ki. 8:29). Psalm 132:13-
18 begins with the Lord’s choice and then traces its consequences
in provision, the ordinances of religion and monarchy and the
overthrow of enemies. The Lord knew all about Jerusalem’s
threatened water-supply, yet he made and planned (‘moulded’ as
a potter would) this city. He did not leave it short of water but
arranged the supply in such a way that living in Jerusalem was a
recurring challenge to faith. Hezekiah’s tunnel contradicted the
155
ISAIAH 22:12-15
principle of faith on which the Lord planned and fashioned his
city. cia: The Lord, the LoRD Almighty: see verse 5. This title spells
out the real resource and strength of the Lord’s people. Compared
with him, what are walls and water-courses? Consequently, the
priority in every crisis is to fly to. God in penitence and contrition
(Joel 2:12ff.). Tearing the hair and sackcloth were outward
displays of the inner reality of sorrow.
13. Isaiah returns to the theme of verse 2 and reveals why he
found their jollity so offensive: they were applauding human
works (8-11) and contradicting the mind of God (12). For tomorrow we die: it is most unlikely that they said these words
for, with their walls and water, this was the very thing they
thought they had secured themselves against. The prophet is not
reporting their words but verbalizing their attitudes (see on 28:14-15). In their denial of the significance of the spiritual
dimension of life, they were in fact affirming that if what they
had done did not save them, nothing could.
14. This is an exceedingly solemn verse in both wording and
content. Revealed this in my hearing is (lit.) ‘has unveiled
himself in my ear’. Isaiah stresses objectivity, the coming of
revelation from outside; authenticity, a revelation of the Lord
himself; and receptivity, the genuine action of the human ear. Sin
(‘dw6n): iniquity, the inner reality of sin in the fallen nature, see
6:7. Atoned (Vkapar): covered by an exact payment (6:7). Where
(as 12 shows) there is no ‘Woe is me!’ (6:5), there is no sending
of the seraph on a mercy-flight to the sinner. The sin of unbelief —
no looking to the Lord (11), no penitence (12), total reliance on
human saving works (8-11) — is the unforgivable sin. This whole
passage is a set piece on the contrast between salvation by faith
and salvation by works.
Cases in point (22:15—25). See p. 151. The decision whether
to live by faith or by self-reliant works is individual as well as
national. In this way Isaiah’s presentation of two case studies
constitutes a call to his contemporaries to examine themselves. In
addition, on the assumption that Shebna and Eliakim are those
mentioned in 36:3, 11, 22 and 37:2, they also provide one of Isaiah’s interim fulfilments in which observers could see the word of the Lord at work before their very eyes. Verses 15-19 focus on Shebna, ‘the self-reliant’. These verses fall into two parts: 15-16, the Lord’s opposition to Shebna; 17— 19, the Lord’s intentions for Shebna. 15. The Lord ...: see verse 5. The Lord operates worldwide (5) and also individually. Steward (soken): used only once
156
ISAIAH 22:16-25
elsewhere, for David’s nurse-concubine (1 Ki. 1:2-4). It is de- signedly derogatory here, suggesting a fawning, ready-to-please
attitude. ‘Lackey’ might be a good rendering. Jn charge of: as 1
aa 4:6; 2 Chronicles 26:21. It was plainly a very important office.
16. What are you doing ...? is virtually identical with the
initial question in verse 1b. It remains dismissive, literally ‘What
have you here and who have you here?’ The idiomatic use of the
interrogatives suggest that Shebna has no personal (‘what’) or
inherited (‘who’) claim to the importance he is giving himself as
seen in his considerable burial arrangements.'
17-18. In his own estimation he is a ‘big’ man (mighty man), a
person of consequence, but to the Lord, a ball to be hurled into
the distance. It can be assumed that one such as Shebna could
have been removed off to Assyria in any one of Sennacherib’s
forays. Just as, try as he will, he cannot perpetuate his glory into
the future and beyond the grave (16), so also his present pomp —
literally ‘the chariots of your glory’ — is equally vulnerable. Such
- self-important, self-seeking servant is a disgrace to the royal ouse.
19. The change here to first person is continued in the Eliakim
natrative (20-25). This verse, therefore, acts, as a bridge between the two.
Verses 20-25 mirror the Shebna oracle: 20—23a, the Lord’s
intentions for Eliakim; 23b—25, the Lord’s warning to Eliakim.
When given a position of authority (20-23) he could easily fall
into salvation by works: the future of his family could be seen to
depend on him. They might come to trust Eliakim, his position
and his power for their security.
21-23a. Robe ... sash are the insignia of office; authority is
the status and actual power the insignia indicate; father is the
mode of exercise of that power; key is the power to make and
enforce binding decisions; peg is a ‘tent-peg’ (unless the context
indicates otherwise, e.g. Jdg. 16:14), which, securely driven into
a firm place, holds the tent of the state secure no matter how the
wind blows. 23b—25. Eliakim is, therefore, inevitably a person on whom
much depends. He has authority and responsibility for its proper
exercise; people need his fatherly care, and the whole structure of
the state needs him to hold it in place. Everything then depends
on how he sees himself and how he allows others to see him. It is
not just that leadership position can become pride of position,
1 See D. J. Wiseman, ‘Shebna’, in /BD, vol. 3, p. 1431.
157
ISAIAH 23:1-18
national welfare be replaced by family interest, public good by
nourishing a crowd of ‘hangers-on’, but that the Lord as the
object of trust can be replaced by a human object of trust. Just as
the individual is not sufficient for himself (Shebna) neither is he
sufficient for others (Eliakim). NIV makes these verses a
prediction. It is rather more telling to make them hypothetical:
‘Should he, however, become ... and they hang upon him ... in
that day the peg will give way ...’ Corrupting power may tempt
Eliakim to self-importance and to yield to adulation. Give way ...
be sheared off: the collapse will come about by internal insufficiency (give way) and external force (be sheared), for only
the Lord is sufficient and he will allow that position to no other. He alone is the LORD Almighty and he is committed — ‘for
the LORD has spoken’— to the principle that he alone must be
trusted.
v. Tyre: holiness to the Lord (23:1-18). Both elements in the
title (p. 144) of this second pentad of oracles have proved to be
true. ‘Night’ was reflected in the Babylonian twilight of 21:1—10,
the lone voice from the darkness (21:11-12), the uncomforted
trouble of the Arabian tribes (21:13-17) and Jerusalem’s unforgivable sin (22:14). But there have also been flashes of ‘dawn’:
the message of comfort to the Lord’s crushed people (21:10), the
invitation to enquire again because day comes (21:12), and now —
surprisingly — Tyre’s merchandise becomes holiness to the Lord (23:18).
Hiram of Tyre ‘always loved David’ and continued his covenant and co-operation with Solomon (1 Ki. 5:1-12). But there
was another side to it: Solomon was corrupted by Phoenician
wives (1 Ki. 11:1-5), and the religious error he introduced
remained until Isaiah’s time (2 Ki. 23:13). In the northern
kingdom, Tyrian Baalism made a bid to replace Yahwism in the
time of Jezebel (1 Ki. 16-18). Hostility to Tyre is evident
throughout the Prophets (Je. 47:4; Am. 1:9-11; Joel 3:4; Zc. 9:2-
4); only of Tyre does Ezekiel fail to say that they will yet know
the Lord (Ezk 25:7, 11; 30:26). Isaiah, however, makes Tyre the
beacon of hope at the end of this second series of oracles, and fittingly so. Throughout the first series (13 — 20) the emphasis lay on the political upheavals of the world and the downfall of nations and states; throughout the second series (21 — 23) the emphasis rested on fallen gods (21:9) and unforgivable sin (22:14). Therefore, just as Egypt the political oppressor (Ex. 1:22) became the bearer of hope in the first series (19:24—25), so Tyre the religious corrupter becomes the hope-symbol in the
158
ISAIAH 23:1-7
second. The care that a Phoenician widow once gave to a prophet
(1 Ki. 17:8-16) will be the norm of a coming relationship of
holiness (23:18). The oracle is in two parts: 1-14, the fall of
Tyre; 15-18, , the return and renewal of Tyre.
Lament over the fall of Tyre (23:1-14). The lament begins
(1) and ends (14) with Tyre’s famous shipping lines; downfall is
reported in verses 2-7, dealing in turn with Tyre (2-3), Sidon (4—
5) and Tyre again (6—7); the agencies, divine and human, behind
the fall, are revealed in verses 8-13 with the same order of Tyre
(8-9), Sidon (10-12b) and Tyre (12c-13). Egypt is referred to
three times (3, 5, 10), further establishing a link between the two oracles as above.
1. Tyre is the only non-enigmatic title in this series (see pp.
111, 144 above). Isaiah offers no explanation, and we can only
guess that he wished to ‘earth’ his predictions: eschatology
happens to real people. The strength and durability of Tyre, along
with its crass materialism and idolatry, made it in any case a good
proving ground for the sovereignty of the Lord. Zarshish: the
shipping is called to wail because if Tyre fell their trade would
fall with it. Most references to Tarshish are satisfied by the
traditional identification with Tartessus, a mining area in Spain,
though its exact location is unknown.' What is clear is that a ‘ship
of Tarshish’ (2:16, NIV mg.) came to mean a ship capable of the
longest voyages. From the land: the fleet is ‘off Cyprus’ making
for Tyre, only to be met with the news that house and harbour,
i.e. city and port, are gone.
2-3. Silent, like our word ‘quiet’, can also express stillness.
This opening word contrasts with recollections of the port of Tyre
(the island) bustling with businessmen and sailors (2bc), importing and exporting (3). Shihor: a synonym for the Nile (Jos.
13:3) 4-5. In verse 3 the merchants of Sidon were busy, but now
they are ashamed, a word with the sense of reaping shame
through disappointment. The sea has spoken: the sea mourns its
loss. Tyre had provided it with its children, the sailors who spent
their lives at sea, but with the fall of Tyre the sea is as if it never
had those devoted to it. But Egypt too will be distraught, looking
to Tyrian merchants and sailors as she did to oversee her vast
export trade in grain. The fall of Tyre was a disaster with
worldwide implications.
6-7. Now comes the evacuation of refugees. In a fine image of
the reversal of their fortunes they travel in their loss, as once they
1 See J. A. Thompson, ‘Tarshish’, in NBD, p. 1153.
159
ISAIAH 23:8-13
had to make profit, to Tarshish. To settle: to become a temporary
resident. Tyre had no imperialist aims; she set out to make
money, not conquests. This has been the central thrust of the
review of Tyre (2-3), Sidon (4-5) and Tyre again (6-7): businessmen, trade, Egypt’s concern for her export market. In the
matching oracle (19) Egypt represented the power of the world
pressing upon the people of God; Tyre stands for the ways of the
world in economic planning, commercial cupidity, and so on.
Verses 8-13 begin with an opening question that sets the
scene. What agencies have brought Tyre to dust? The enquiry
follows the same pattern of Tyre (8-9), Sidon (10, 12b) and Tyre
12c-13). 8-9. ‘vee achieved such dominance by its trade that it could
influence appointments (bestower of crowns) and insist on
virtually royal respect (princes) being shown to its
representatives. But the time came when the bestower of crowns
came face to face with the ‘Disposer Supreme and Judge of the
earth’, the LORD Almighty, and Tyre’s pride was no more to be
tolerated. Like the Day of the Lord itself (2:12-17), so every
interim day has this characteristic, the overthrow of all that
embodies godless pride.
10-12b. Harbour is mézah, which, if it has anything to do
with shipping, means ‘ship-building’, not ‘anchorage’; but in Job
12:21 and Psalm 109:19 it means ‘belt’ and is used here metaphorically of Tyre’s grip on Tarshish. Now that Tyre’s power is
broken, Tarshish can move at will. This has not required an
extensive exercise of divine power, nothing but an outstretched
hand (lla; cf Ex. 14:16; 15:46, 12), a word of command (11c)
and a voice that said (12a).
12c—13. The first two consequences of the outstretched hand
were (12ab) loss of joy (revelling) and of power (crushed). Now
(12cd) follow loss of tenure (up, cross over) and loss of rest. In
verses 11-12 the Lord gave the order. Who received it? Assyria
began its imperial expansion in 745 BC under Tiglath Pileser. In
738 he was able to impose a military governor on Tyre, but Tyre was a restive vassal. Shalmaneser (727-722) besieged Tyre unsuccessfully and at the end of the century Tyre was still rebelling. In 701 Sennacherib devastated the mainland and did vast damage to Tyre’s trade and it was not until about 630, with the decline of Assyria, that Tyre began to revive. Yet it remained restless within the great empires, and in 586 Nebuchadnezzar opened a thirteen-year siege but without ultimate success. The rock citadel withstood all attempts to take it until it fell to Alexander the Great in 332. In the light of all this there is no
160
ISAIAH 23:14-18
problem that Isaiah should be concerned with Tyre. It constituted
such a power in his day it would have been strange if he had
nothing to say about it. If his oracle forecasts the fall of Tyre,
then this did not happen till the time of Alexander. The thrust of
the oracle, however, is that Tyre’s trade has been brought to a
standstill, with loss of life and people taking flight. In the light of
this a reference to Assyria in verse 13 has the merit of simplicity.
The devastations Sargon caused in south Mesopotamia were
notorious. Seven kings from Cyprus were present at his coronation and Sargon records that when they heard what he was
doing in Chaldea ‘their hearts were rent, fear fell on them’. Isaiah
could, therefore, well say Look at the land of the Babylonians
(i.e. “Chaldeans’) as a warning. If the refugees wonder why they
will not be received and allowed to rest anywhere — who would
risk provoking Assyria by identifying with its foes? For thanks to
Assyria’s savage attentions its people became of no account —
maybe, even, “this non-existent people’, its land become a place
for desert creatures — the motif of the incoming beasts pointing to
the end of human occupation, and its buildings a ruin.
14 is an inclusio with verse 1, rounding off the lament with
only one difference. Tarshish may indeed have acquired liberty of
movement with the fall of Tyre (10) but it has also lost its
fortress: Tyre’s trade was its financial bulwark, and with that
gone Tarshish too is exposed. Verse 1 says they have no place to
go to; 14 says they have no secure place to stay.
The postscript: Tyre’s renewal (23:15-18). Isaiah offers
another interim fulfilment, the recovery of Tyre after a period of
seventy years, but beyond that again lies a different renewal of
Tyre as ‘holiness to the Lord’.
15-17. The seventy years extended from the campaigns of
Sennacherib (701) until the terminal decline of Assyria (say about 630) which allowed Tyre to spread its wings again. The
span of: literally ‘as the days of one king’. The expression does
not occur elsewhere but presumably means ‘exactly reckoned and
recorded’ (cf. 16:14; 21:16). Kings kept daily records of their
reigns (1 Ki. 14:29, where ‘annals’ is ‘the words of the days’).
Thus each day of the seventy years was recorded as it passed
until the precise period was completed. Prostitute: an apt symbol
of Tyre, where everything was done for money. Cf Amos’ charge
(1:9) that in Tyre nothing was allowed to interfere with profitmaking. Deal with is too punitive. The verb pdgqad, ‘to visit’,
must always be shaped to its context. Here, since Tyre reappears
unchanged on the world’s scene, we might translate it ‘restore’.
18. But there is a new Tyre in the divine mind. Tyre would be
161
ISAIAH 24:1 — 27:13
there to provide materials for temple-building at the time of the
return (Ezr. 3:7) but, like the return itself, this was only a token of
a fulfilment yet to come (Rev. 21:24-26; cf Is. 60:5). Earnings
(etnan): Deuteronomy 23:18, using the same word, forbade such
earnings as an offering to the Lord, but now all is transformed
and all that the old life had meant and gained can be consecrated.
Isaiah foresees a new, priestly status for Tyre: set apart for is (lit.)
‘holiness to’, the very word that adorned the high priest (Ex.
28:36); a new spirit replacing the old mercenary, acquisitive .
spirit: not stored ... hoarded but given; a new harmony, linking
Tyre with those who live before the LORD. For this incorporation
of Tyre in Zion, see Psalm 87:4.
c. The third series: The world city and the city of God
(24:1 — 27:13)
These chapters are often called ‘the Isaiah Apocalypse’. Apocalyptic writing, as exemplified in Daniel in the Old Testament and
Revelation in the New, is a special branch of eschatology with its
own characteristics. For example, it relies heavily on symbolism
(using animals to represent nations and their horns to represent
kings), mysterious numbers and veiled references to periods of
time, and angelic figures as the mediators of revelation. In the
light of this it is hard to see why Isaiah 24 — 27 should be thought
to be apocalyptic. To look forward to the End-time is, of course,
another characteristic of the apocalyptists, but it is equally typical
of the prophets: they too saw history as governed by the divine
purpose, serving as an arena of conflict between the Lord and the
forces of evil, and reaching a climax of both human wickedness and divine power in the Day of the Lord. Isaiah 24 — 27 is far
nearer to Matthew 24 than it is to Daniel 7 — 12. In a word, it is
heavily eschatological and this is the only (and insufficient)
ground for claiming it as apocalyptic.
In these chapters, then, Isaiah is looking on to the End. He
abandons the oracle structure which has served him in chapters
13 — 20 and 21 — 23 and adopts a form which is a mixture of
poems and songs, rather like a cantata. Nevertheless, even though the sharp edges of his presentation in 13 — 20 and the hazier outlines of 21 — 23 are gone, changes of subject and structural markers divide the eschatological cantata into five sections. Thus in 24:1, 19-20, the ‘broken earth’ theme forms an inclusio. The unheralded outburst of song in 25:1-12 leaves 24:21-23 as a distinct unit. 26:1-20 is a unitary statement about the Lord’s people, secure amid the turmoil of the world and the coming judgment of God, and 27:1 (the great sword) and 13 (the great
162
ISAIAH 24:1-20
trumpet) enclose the final section of the cantata. These five
sections tally with the five sections of the two preceding series:
the actual Babylon (13 — 14) and the continuing Babylon principle (21:1-10) reach their awesome conclusion in the downfall
of the city where nothing means anything (24:1—20, see esp. 10);
the promised Davidic shoot (14:28-32) and the extended
prolongation of days and nights (21:11—12) climax in the Lord’s
reign in Zion ‘after many days’ (24:21—23); the sad refusal of
Moab to find security in Zion (15-16) and the failure of Gentile
mutual security (21:13—18) resolve themselves into full provision
for all nations (except Moab, 25:10—11) in the great banquet; the
people of God, compromising (17-18) and self-sufficient (22),
are now perfected as the people of faith enjoying peace within the
strong city (26); and the theme of ‘one world, one people and one
God’, forecast through Egypt and Assyria in chapter 19 and
through Tyre in 23, is fulfilled in 27, with its return to the EgyptAssyria motif (27:12—13).
i. The city of meaninglessness (24:1-20). We can discover
the meaning of this passage through its structure. It begins and
ends on the theme of the devastated earth (1-3, 18e—20); the
withering of the world in verses 4—6 is balanced by the wasting
individual in 16c—18d; and at the centre the song that is stilled
(7-12) matches the song that is heard (13—16b). The background
to the whole passage is found in the flood narrative in Genesis 6 —
9. Both passages refer to the ‘windows’ of heaven (floodgates,
18c; Gn. 7:11) and to the everlasting covenant (5; Gn. 9:16); the
curse (6) in the context of the ‘vine’ theme (7) looks back to
Noah the vinedresser and to the post-diluvian curse (Gn. 9:20ff.).
Isaiah is forecasting a divine visitation on the same world scale,
obliterating an old order because of its sin. In a broader but
deeply significant way the contraction from the devastation of the
world (1) to the downfall of the city (10) reflects the movement
from the universalism of Genesis 9:19 to the particularism of the
city-building of Genesis 11:1-9, linked by the motif-word
‘scattering’. The sin at Shinar was humankind turning to
humankind for security and community. The new technology of
bricks and mortar put into people’s hands the means of their own
salvation: they could create community and safety, and curb their
perceived tendency to scatter by living within a wall of their own
making. The city, therefore, is the human attempt to impose order
and create security without reference to God. As Isaiah sees the
End, this fever of self-salvation will be worldwide, and the whole
earth (1) will be as it were a global city (10). As at Shinar in the
163
ISAIAH 24:1-5
beginning, and throughout human history, this is the point at
which the Lord says a decisive ‘No’ and comes in judgment.
There is another link also with the flood background: at the time
of that judgment, grace isolated Noah and his family (Gn. 6:8); so
also, at the End, the truly deathly silence of the fallen city (8-10)
is broken by song (13—16b), the.song of the remnant (13). Thus
this opening element in the five-part cantata matches its opening
predecessors in the earlier series, not only in the Babylon-city
theme (13:1 — 14:27; 21:1-10), but also in the great truth that the Lord in wrath remembers mercy, so organizing the world, its history and its destiny as to save and secure his own people
(14:1-2; 21:10). 1-3, The earth devastated. These verses are bracketed by
what the LorD is proposing to do (1) and how the LorD has
spoken (3c), and also by the action which the Lord will perform,
lay waste ... laid waste (1a, 3a). The emphasis is on totality:
place and people (lcd), people without exception (2) and every
place (3ab). Human sin infects the human environment (2:12ff.),
and is the ultimate environmental threat. Every aspect of life — religious (2b), domestic (2cd), and commercial (2eg) — as well as every individual is under judgmental
scrutiny. The active (Jay waste, 3) of 1 is now the passive, laid
waste, What the Lord plans will happen.
4-6, The withering of the world. The imagery changes from
earthquake and plunder (lcd, 3b) — things which come upon the
world — to withering, something that arises from within. It affects
place (4ab) and people (4c).
4-S. Earth ... world: the former (eres) is the physical earth as
such; the latter (tébé/), the world as inhabited. The expression the
exalted of the earth, literally ‘the height of the people of the
earth’, is unparalleled. It can hardly single out the ‘upper classes’,
but we note a gradual rise from the earth as ‘thing’ to the world as
inhabited, then, possibly, to ‘that exalted reality, the people ...’,
i.e. humankind as the crown of creation: the withering disease
runs throughout. But the blame runs in the reverse direction, for
the earth is defiled by its people ( 5) (cf. Nu. 35:33; Ps. 106:38;
Je. 3:1-2, 9). The ‘thorns and thistles’ of Genesis 3:18 show both that the earth as the repository of the life of God in the soil fights back against the sinner, and also that human sin has infected the earth and corrupted its goodness. By its people: literally ‘under’, under human dominion, the influence of their misbehaviour. First, they have transgressed revealed truth (5b). Disobeyed (V ‘abar) is to cross over a boundary. The laws: the plural denotes ‘law of every sort’ and ‘law covering every aspect of life’. But the basic
164
ISAIAH 24:6-10
idea of law (t6rd) is not so much authoritative imposition as
authoritative instruction. God spoke but they did not submit.
Secondly, they changed the unchangeable (5c). Violated (Vhalap)
is used of one thing replacing another. Statutes: from Vhdgag, to
carve, engrave, hence to make a permanent mark. They rejected
divine moral absolutes and invented an innovative morality.
Thirdly, they discarded a given relationship with God (5d).
Everlasting covenant is used of the Noahic covenant (Gn. 9:16),
the Abrahamic covenant (Ps. 105: 10), the Sabbath (Lv. 24:8) and
the Davidic covenant (2 Sa. 23:5) with its future messianic
fulfilment (55:3; 61:8). But the world has not wished to live
faithfully under the promise of the rainbow (Gn. 9:12-17), nor
has it seen itself in need of the blessing that comes only through
Abraham’s seed (Gn. 12:3; 22:18; Gal. 3:8), nor has it ordered its
timetable so as to remember the Sabbath (Ex. 20:8-11; Dt. 5:12—
15), nor has it wanted this Man to reign over it (Lk. 19:14) nor
loved his appearing (2 Tim. 4:8).
6. Therefore: it is no accident but a holy, moral consequence
that earth and people perish. It is the Lord’s curse, ‘the curse of
the covenant’ (Lv. 26:25-45; Dt. 11:26-28; 28:15ff.; Dn. 9:11;
Zc. 5:5), not the Lord breaking off covenantal relationships but enforcing covenant sanctions.
7-12, The stilled song: the fallen city. The Hebrew of these
verses can be set out in fifteen lines, mostly of three words a line.
The effect is as of fifteen successive hammer blows demolishing
a city. Joy has gone (7a), and satisfaction (7b—9): the city lies
desolated (10). Satisfaction is gone (11) and so has security (12).
7-9. Their lifestyle was one of self-gratification. There is a
colossal irony behind it all: on the one hand they look to the
productivity of the earth to service their wants, but (5-6) it is
their character and conduct which blight and curse the earth!
They are subject to a savage law of diminishing returns, and in
the end (7a) both product (wine) and source (vine) are alike gone.
But even before this point is reached, they have found themselves
seeking satisfaction in that which no longer satisfies (9).
10. In the End, the whole this-worldly fabric of life built by
human resources without calling upon God or acknowledging
him will suffer collapse. This is the world city. Isaiah calls it ‘the
city of tohii’. The word is translated ‘formless’ in Genesis 1:2,
where it is used of the primary state of the earth. The divine
Potter had, so to speak, brought into being the pliable clay but it
was as yet without the impress of his hands. In itself it did not
contain any meaning, it showed no tendency towards a purpose;
it was shrouded in darkness and covered with all the instability of
165
ISAIAH 24:11—16b
water. It was tohi. Jeremiah (4:23-26) had a vision of the world
returned to tohii, deprived of all that made it habitable, without
purposeful activity. It was without what only God can give. The
‘city of toha’ opts for that life: life without God, therefore
without order, purpose or those things which sustain and gratify
life. The ‘city of tohi’ is the-city where anything goes and
nothing matters. The moral absolutes of verse 5 have been
rejected, and the end of that choice is total relativism of values,
uncontrolled individualism. Thus Isaiah started with the Babylon
he knew (13:1ff.), foresaw the ongoing spirit of Babylon ever- present in world history (21:1ff.) and finally came to the ultimate
Babel, Shinar resurrected, where at length humankind’s selfsufficiency would bring their whole world down about their ears. 11. This verse corresponds to verse 9 but brings an additional
poignancy. In 9 the supposed stimulants failed to stimulate but,
having left God out of their reckoning, people have nothing left
to do but cry out for failed remedies. 12. The opening lines of this section (7) noted that life in the
meaningless city was unsatisfying; the concluding lines note that
it is impossible.
13-16b, A song in the silence. Isaiah is a master of unexpected hope — and of drama in its introduction. Here the
‘battering’ of the gate (12) merges into a different sound of
‘beating’ (13c), the blows which harvest the crop. The ‘few’
survivors of verse 6 turns out to be a worldwide ingathering; the
song of the city fades to be replaced by another song, acclaiming
the Righteous One. The section consists of an explanation (13
begins with ‘For’), a description (14), a command (15) and a comment (16ab).
13. ‘For’ looks back over all that has preceded, where statements of destruction (1-3, 7-12) bracket the note of a few
surviving (4-6). This is how it will be and what it means. Beaten:
this is the correct way to harvest olives and, reading through from
verse 12, the assumption is that the ‘grim reaper’ is still at work,
but suddenly harvesting becomes gleaning, the careful gathering
of what remains after (lit.) ‘the grape-harvest is finished’.
14-16b. The prophet hears the songs arising in the west and calls for the song to begin in the east. So the song spreads until it is coming from the ends of the earth. Islands, see 11:11; 40:15. The song of the ultimate worldwide gathering is focused on the Lord in his exaltedness (majesty), in his essential worth (give glory), in his self-revelation (name), in his exclusivity as the God of Israel, in his loveliness (Glory, s°bi, 16; see 4:2) and in his character as the Righteous One. There is no sense that the nations
166
ISAIAH 24:16c-20
have found Yahweh incognito in whatever national gods they
formerly cherished; rather, these have been jettisoned in favour of
the God of another nation, Israel. His name includes his work as
Saviour and Redeemer and this would undoubtedly resound in
their praises, but the note of climax is his righteousness, for his
saving mercies are grounded in, and must satisfy, his justice
(45:21; Rom. 3:26).
16c—-18d, A personal reaction and warning. In 21:4 Isaiah
discovered an ambivalence in himself: longing for the fall of
Babylon but finding its reality too grim to bear. It is even more so
as he contemplates the End: his vital energies ebb away under the
shock of what is to come. Woe to me (16c): as 6:5. Isaiah now
feels the hopelessness of others as keenly as once he felt his own.
On the one hand, the world goes carelessly on in its moral indifference, literally ‘for betrayers betray; with betrayal, betrayers
betray’ (16d). None but Isaiah could multiply the same word like
this and achieve such literary effect. It is a powerful statement of
moral perversity. Cf 21:2, where the words may have originally
been used (cf 33:1) to define the wickedness of Assyria, but now
they encompass a whole decadent world. How the Bible picks as
the really damning sins things which mean little in popular
thought! — the unclean speech of 6:5; unreliability and deceitfulness here. But on the other hand, there is the doom which
awaits: ferror ... pit ... snare. The Hebrew is assonantal, pahad
wapahat wapah, suggesting that they all belong to the same
system of inescapable doom. O people is (lit.) ‘O inhabitant’. The
judgment is universal but the experience is individual.
18e—-20, The earth broken. This concluding section acts as an
inclusio with verses 1-3. In the opening section the spotlight fell
on the divine Agent; here it falls on the moral cause that provoked him. As at the great flood, the whole created order is
shattered. Isaiah multiplies verbs of breakdown (19) and then
embroiders the scene with two similes: the drunkard falls through
internal loss of co-ordination; the hut is shattered by the external
storm. The external factor is the hostile agency of the wrath of
God (1-3); the internal factor is the heaviness of its rebellion
(pesa‘; see 1:2), the stark, single cause of all the woe: the
human will deliberately flouting the will of God. God is against
such (1-3); the created order too is its foe (18ef), but also it is
the heaviness of its own weight upon it (20c) that-brings the
system crashing down never to rise again.
ii. Ultimately ... the King! (24:21-23). This is the first of six
elaborations of 24:1-20. The phrase ‘in that day’ occurs once in
167
ISAIAH 24:21—22
each of the first five and twice in the sixth. In Isaiah’s careful
editing they present a coherent picture:
24:21 The Lord’s victory ZT The Lord’s victory
25:9 The saved and the 24:2 The Lord’s people
excluded and his foes
26:1 The strong city 27:12-13 The world in Zion
with open gates
The present poem sums up the series which began with 14:28-
32. Against premature Philistine rejoicing, Isaiah warned of a
great Davidic king to come; to the enquiring Edomite (21:11-12)
he spoke of prolonged waiting; but the climax still comes only
after many days (22d); the king deadly as a serpent (14:29) will
punish (21); the darkness (21:11-12) will be swallowed in
brightness (23a); the long progression of day and night (21:11-
12) will end as moon and sun are transcended (23a); and the
promised king (14:30) will be the Lord (23b). 21-22. The first part of chapter 24 gave the same sort of
undiversified overview of worldwide calamity as did its model,
the flood narrative, but in the first in that day elaboration Isaiah
particularizes: the rulers of celestial and terrestrial realms will be
tackled and imprisoned. Punish (Vpagad): cf, 23:17. The base
meaning is ‘to pay attention to’ and, arising from this, to weigh
the issues and take appropriate action. Hence the verb must
always be judged contextually: here, a ‘visitation of judgment’.
The Lord, then, will ‘visit’ (lit.) ‘the host of the height in the
height and the kings of the earth upon the earth’. Each will be
dealt with in their own sphere, where they are at their most potent
but where the writ of the Lord’s sovereignty has never ceased to
run — as will be manifested in that day. Isaiah does not link the
heavenly and earthly powers in the manner of Daniel 8:3ff;
10:13, 20-21. He simply notes that there are guilty celestial
powers who will be included with terrestrial powers in a
comprehensive settlement extending over the whole ‘field’ of
divine creation. Prisoners ... prison: deprived of power and
subjected to due punishment. Punished (\paqad) after many
days: just as punished forms an inclusio with the same verb in
verse 21a, so after many days qualifies in that day. The singular
day denotes that the time is fixed, the event precisely settled in
the divine programme; the many days remove the date from human reckoning and impose the discipline of patience and the exercise of expectancy.
168
ISAIAH 24:23
23. The ‘Day’ is often linked with brightness (30:26; 60:19- 20). Isaiah picks poetic words for moon and sun, calling attention to their natural brightness: the moon is ‘the white one’ (/° band,
30:26; Song 6:10); the sun is ‘the hot one’ (hammdé, 30:26; Jb.
30:28; Ps. 19:6; Song 6:10). But bright as they are, they will (so
to say) hang their heads in shame at being such poor things by
comparison. For introduces the explanation of this wondrous
brightness: it is caused by the mere fact of the divine reign! Mount Zion and Jerusalem: this reign is the climax and
consummation of the Davidic monarchy. Before ... elders recalls
Exodus 24:9-11, when the Sinai covenant was consummated
with the Lord among the elders of Israel. There they saw but his
feet; then they will live in the light of his full glory. When the
Lord comes to reign he will bring to their intended fulfilment all
the ways of blessing — Mosaic as well as Davidic — in which he
has shepherded his people.
iii. Salvation and provision: the world on Mount Zion
(25:1-12). This passage is made up of two sections of testimony
(1-5, 9-10a) and two descriptive statements (6-8, 10b—12). As so
often, Isaiah has taken pieces which originated on differing
occasions in his ministry but has brought them into a telling
‘mosaic’ that perfectly fits its present context. The fallen city of
24:10 reappears (25:24) but with the fresh thought that it was
central to an oppressive system. There were those, here described
as poor and needy (4), who, in that city, found themselves under
the heel of the strong and ruthless (3), dominated by foreigners
(5). They lived as underdogs and aliens, but this is now past. In
24:21-13 the Lord’s reign on Mount Zion was viewed in its
victorious and scintillating glory; now Mount Zion is the place
where all peoples and nations find abundant provision (6) and
deliverance from death and sorrow (7-8). They describe this as
salvation (9), and the refuge of which they sang (4) is his gently
overshadowing hand (10a).
All this reveals also how the passage meshes into the wider
panorama of chapters 13 — 27. The third oracle in the first two
series focused on Gentile need. In chapters 15 — 16 the chronic plight of Moab could have been met through the throne of David
established in Zion (16:5), but Moab’s pride (16:6) could not
swallow this loss of face and Moab resolved to go it alone. In
21:13-17, the tribes of Arabia huddle together for mutual aid,
sharing the food and water that in fact solve nothing. But now
(25:6) all peoples enjoy the best of meats and the finest of wines
on Mount Zion. They have at last come home to where the king
169
ISAIAH 25: 1-5
reigns — all of them, that is, except Moab (25:10b-12), still trying
in pride to go it alone. ,
1-5, Individual testimony to deliverance. In 24:14-16, with
dramatic imagination, Isaiah heard singing in the midst of
overthrow. The world city was silent in its ruins but worldwide
there were songs. This is the theme of verses 1-5, praise (1) in
the midst of overthrow (2) and of silence (5). The Lord has acted
as he long since decided to do (1); those who considered
themselves strong now have to acknowledge a greater strength
than theirs (2-3); in all this time he has been a stronghold for his downtrodden people (4) until the time came to still the song of
the ruthless (5). 1. My God, I: cf. 8:9ff. The believing remnant possesses a
personal knowledge of God. Praise, (Vyad4): ‘to give thanks’, a
meaning essential here in a passage which dwells on benefits
conferred. Perfect faithfulness is expressed in the Hebrew by two
related nouns (“mind and ’omen) both from V’ameén, ‘to be
reliable’. The idiom of the two nouns together means ‘every
imaginable faithfulness, perfect, quintessential faithfulness’. This
matches the backward look of you have been (4). All through the
years of alien domination the Lord’s downtrodden ones
experienced an impeccably faithful God. Marvellous (pele’):
things that bear the mark of the supernatural, beyond human
doing, finding their origin in another realm (cf. 9:6). Planned is a
noun (‘ésdét, ‘plans’), related to Counsellor (9:6). It is all part of .
the royal messianic vision, the gathering of the world remnant
round the Davidic king (cf also 11:10).
2-3. The people of God have been dominated by foreigners,
strong and ruthless power groups. The background of Egypt and
the exodus is prominent in this passage. Peoples ... cities are both
singular and this must be restored. Isaiah is speaking of the city
of 24:10, the world structured without reference to God. The
citizens of this world city are one people though composed of
many nations, for they are one in ideology: the ‘I can cope’
syndrome that marks a fallen race, coupled with the ‘Who needs
God?’ of the self-sufficient. Honour ... revere: this is not a saving
acknowledgment of the Lord. It is the grudging testimony of
Pharaoh and his officers in Exodus 10:7, 16-17; 12:33, and the cry of those overwhelmed by the glory of the Lord Jesus in Philippians 2:9-11.
4-5. The Lord is with his people in their trouble (4ab); the trouble itself can be savage (4c—f) but the deliverance is to him of the utmost simplicity (5). Refuge (ma‘6z): ‘place of inherent strength’. On poor (dal), see 10:2; on needy (eby6n), see 14:30.
170
ISAIAH 25:6-8
Shelter (mah‘seh is from Vhasd, ‘to seek/take refuge’): it affirms
available shelter, a place to turn to. Storm ... heat: the contrasting
threats are a Hebrew way of saying ‘every sort of threat’. But the
reality so illustrated was the breath of the ruthless. Breath is
riiah, ‘spirit/wind’, and here the more forceful translation ‘blast’
would be suitable. Ruthless (see 3), people of inherent strength
who are prepared to use it without consideration or mercy. In the
mysterious providence of God his people are often in the
situation of 4c-e, yet also, in his perfect faithfulness, in that of
4ab. But when his time comes, all this hostile power is as nothing
to him. The first and third lines of verse 5 deal respectively with
oppressive, killing heat (Sa) and how easily it is relieved by the
shadow of a cloud (Sc); the second and fourth lines deal with the
triumphant enemy roaring in power (5b) and the silencing of his
song (5d).
6-8, The messianic banquet. If the reference to the elders in
24:23 looks back to Exodus 24:11 when the Mosaic covenant was
celebrated in a meal with the elders, this was all that could
happen within the circumstances of the occasion even though the
‘ideal’ expressed (Ex. 19:13) was that the trumpet would invite
all the people. But in the envisaged messianic banquet, every
restriction is lifted and universality is stressed: all peoples ...
peoples are ethnic groups, nations are political entities and faces
individuals, and all are his people.
6. The first act of the Lord: provision. The rich food and finest
of wines contrast with the bread and water of 21:14. Aged wine
can mean the sediment that forms in the process of fermentation
(Zp. 1:12), but here it means the wine itself, purified and matured
by, being allowed to stand. Finest of wines is (lit.) ‘lees
thoroughly filtered’; best of meats (lit.) ‘rich food, filled with
marrow’, a picture of nourishment.
7-8. The second act of the Lord: destruction. Destroy (Vbala’)
is to ‘swallow up’, i.e. to make to disappear utterly. Shroud is a
contextual translation, anticipating the reference to death, but the
Hebrew says ‘the veil’. Sheet is simply ‘covering’. Until that Day
dawns, the whole world is in the shadows. We are born into it and
therefore we do not recognize that what we call light is but
twilight. Paul expressed it by saying ‘the night is nearly over; the
day is almost here’ (Rom. 13:12), and the same thought lies
behind the emphasis on the brightness (24:23) that is to come. In
banishing everything that darkens life, the Lord will in particular
swallow up death for ever. Death is not used just in the sense that
every life is to some extent blighted by transience, but principally
as the primary evidence of the curse imposed in consequence of
171
ISAIAH 25:9-10a
sin (Gn. 2:17; Rom. 3:23; Heb. 2:15; Rev. 21:4; 22:3). In all his
power (Sovereign) and in the fullness of his revealed nature as
LorD (‘Yahweh’), God will dry the tears of his people. From all
faces, i.e. he passes from one to another, individually, until every
tear is dried. The disgrace: see Joshua 5:9 (‘reproach’). The disgrace of living in bondage and misery under alien rule in Egypt
were gone, the days of living under the cloud of the disobedience
of the golden calf were over: full covenant relationships were
restored. So long as we live in this world, there are innumerable
ways in which we are under reproach and hindered (by circum- stances as well as by sin) from living up to our true dignity as his covenant people. But, on that Day, covenant promise will be
covenant reality. 9-10a, Testimony acknowledging God. In that day: this is the
second elaboration (see pp. 167-168 above). They will say is sin- gular in the Hebrew: it is the individual voice fully participating
in a communal testimony to our God, affirming the blessed out- come of trustful hope (we trusted, ‘hoped’), found in the very
presence of the LORD, enjoying his salvation. Subjective experience (we trusted) is matched by objective reality (This is
the LORD). The saving work was wholly his, without human contribution. It was his salvation for which we simply waited in hope and trust. Saved (Vyasa‘, along with its noun, y‘si‘4) is the work of God whereby he rescued his people (Ex. 14:13; 15:2; Ps.
68:19), made them his own (Dt. 32:15: Ps. 98:2-3), restored them
to his favour (Pss. 13:5; 106:4), and brought them under his rule
(Is. 51:6) and care (Ps. 119:123, 155). Verse 10a begins with
‘For’, explanatory of the blessings recounted in 6-9. Rest is
ntiah, which in its simple active mode as here never expresses
violent action (contrast the hiphil, in 28:2). The down-resting
hand is a token of care, shelter and blessing. On this mountain forms an inclusio with the opening of verse 6 and rounds off the
poem. The Lord lays his hand on his mountain and on his gathered, worldwide, saved people: they are his, he accepts them, he purposes their blessing. 10b-12, The midden. But there is another side. The Lord’s hand rests on his people, his foot on Moab (trampled). Moab is mentioned by name (as Tyre in 23:1) to remind that eschatology,
' It is often urged that the idea of the conquest of death is a late arrival in Heb. thought. This is a curious conclusion. Many specialists hold that it was only the trauma of the collapse of the Davidic monarchy that produced OT messianic hope. If in this way hope arises out of the ashes of disaster, what price the constant reality of death? Surely the conclusion that a living God would triumph over death would be one of the earliest conclusions of OT faith.
172
ISAIAH 25:10b — 26:1
both in blessing and bane, happens to real people. Pride excluded Moab in 16:6 and so it remains to the End. This is the ultimate tyranny of a false choice.
10b-11. Isaiah adds two illustrations. The first disgusts us
(10bc) but its implication is inescapable: the alternative to the
banquet is the midden. Under him expresses the thought of direct,
divine, punitive action. The word could equally mean ‘in his
place’: Moab chose what he received. The second illustration is
the swimmer (11a), a perfect simile for a do-it-yourself, go-italone policy. He can master his circumstances, choose and reach
his goal all by his own resources.
12. In verse 11b the Lord brings down the internal factor of
pride, the attempt to be one’s own salvation. Now he brings down
every external edifice of security with which pride surrounds
itself. Three nouns of height are matched by three verbs of
bringing down. Your high fortified walls is ‘the fortified place of
the top security of your walls’ — and not even ruins will be left,
not even rubble, just level ground, the very dust. Pride before a fall indeed!
iv. The strong city (26:1-21). The sin of the people of God
throughout history, in Isaiah’s view, was leaving the way of faith.
Ephraim (17:1ff.) replaced trusting the Lord with trusting Aram
in an alliance; Judah preferred self-reliance (22:1-14). But our
true reality is to be the people of faith, and in this fourth section
of his eschatological cantata Isaiah allows (1-4) righteousness,
faith, peace and salvation to form a cluster of characteristics of
the citizens of the strong city. This, he infers, is true security
amid all the threats and challenges of this world, right through
to final divine judgment. Ephraim experienced only forsaken
and deserted cities (17:2, 9); Jerusalem became a broken,
cannibalized city (22:9-10); believers live in the strong city
(26:1-2). 1-4, Secure in peace (A1; cf. A2, 20-21). Isaiah begins with
the city’s strength (1b—d), states the entrance qualifications (2),
notes its perfect peace and the ground on which it is enjoyed (3)
and calls for maintained trust (4).
1. In that day: see pp. 167-168. This is the third elaboration of
the Day of the Lord as presented in 24:1—-20. The first (24:21)
focused on the Lord’s glorious and victorious reign; the second
(25:9) noted the salvation enjoyed by the universal company
gathered to the great banquet. Now we enter the inner consciousness of those who are the Lord’s people. When that day
comes they will already be by faith in the strong city of salvation.
173
ISAIAH 26:2-5
Strong ... salvation: only the Lord can be the author of salvation;
he does not need to be named. His saving power surrounds the
city like walls and ramparts.
2. Open: cf. Psalm 24:7-10. This call to the gate-keepers is a
vivid way of highlighting the entrance qualifications into the city.
Righteous can only mean ‘right with God’, for much in the rest of
this chapter shows that they are not in the city in virtue of their
own merits. They are, however, those of the nation that keeps
faith. The noun (?emunim) is here plural, expressing amplitude:
faith in its fullness, faith in every circumstance of life.
3. Perfect peace is (lit.) ‘peace, peace’, the idiom of reduplication (6:3) meaning all-embracing peace. Mind (yéser) is the
tendency of the mind (Gn. 6:5), its formulated purposes (Dt.
31:21); it is our mind-set, our way of looking at life. Steadfast is
a passive participle, meaning ‘maintained’ or ‘made/resolved to
be undeviating’. This is the element within the person which is
the key to the divine peace. Because he trusts, ‘because it is
trusted/trust is exercised’. There can, of course, be no belief
without a believer, but what matters is not who is exercising faith
but that faith is being exercised.
4. Faith is not a flash in the pan but a lifelong commitment,
and it is a well-founded approach to life, not because of what it is
(for it may be weak and wobbly) but because of the one in whom
it reposes, for the LORD ... is the Rock eternal. The LORD, the LorD is ‘Yah Yahweh’. The diminutive ‘Yah’ is a name of
endearment (12:2; Ex. 15:2; Ps. 118:14) which most frequently
appears in ‘Hallelujah’. The idiom (lit.) ‘in Yahweh is an
everlasting rock’ means ‘Yahweh is the very essence of what an
everlasting rock should be’ (cf 17:2), durable, changeless and of saving efficacy (as in Ex. 17).
5-6, Down to the dust (B1; cf. B2, 16-19). The ‘For’ with
which verse 5 begins introduces an explanation. Part of the
security offered by the ‘strong city’ (1) is the destruction of
the lofty city (5), their oppressor. This victory is the Lord’s;
his people’s part in it is only to trample the dust left by the victory.
5. According to 24:22, this victory will be ‘after many days’. We should therefore treat the first verb in verse 5 as a perfect of certainty: ‘he has determined to’; the remaining verbs (imperfects) express the future acts of the Lord. The ‘strong city’ is not only the security of the life to come but security here and now for those who have already come to Mount Zion (Heb. 12:22) and still await the final victory (Heb. 10:13). On high is either the pride of those who live there, or the secure height they
174
ISAIAH 26:6-9
think they have made for themselves, or the supernatural dimensions of the Lord’s victory (24:21). If Isaiah had some particular
city in mind when he first composed this poem it no longer
matters. Just as 25:6 looks to the ideal — what actual Jerusalem
could accommodate all nations to a banquet? — so the Jofty city is a figure for the world organized without God.
_ 6. All the oppressed ... poor can do is enter into the Lord’s victory.
7-9, The divinely smoothed path (C1; cf. C2, 12-15). Though
they are already in the ‘strong city’ (1-3), the righteous are at the
same time waiting for the Lord to act (8), desiring him (9) and
living in a world where his judgments are abroad (9). But faith
and obedience mark their lives. They accept their allotted path as
God-ordained (7), hold firm in expectation (8-9) and steadfastly
keep his laws (8a).
7. The righteous are those who are right with God (on the
ground of faith, 2). The voice of faith says that the path they walk
is level, heading ‘straight’ for the target, and smooth, easy to
negotiate. They are like the pilgrim of Psalm 84:6 who treats the
valley of Baca as if full of springs! Upright (yasar) is related to
level (mésarim), that is to say the upright One (Pss. 25:8; 82:15)
appoints a path for us which matches his nature. It runs in a
‘straight’ line from conversion to glory and places rough in
prospect are smooth in retrospect.
8-9. Yes: ‘What’s more!’ The righteous, who accept the
ordering of life as from the hand of the Lord, commit themselves
to it in a spirit of obedience. Laws (mispdatim) is ‘judgments’, the
authoritative decisions — and sometimes the authoritative
sentences — that a judge pronounces. Either meaning suits here:
the Lord’s people walk in obedience to what he has decided is
right, and also amid his earthly discipline (Heb. 12:1-10). So
they wait for him, in patient faith, until he strikes his enemies to
the ground (5-6). They do not seek altered circumstances, but
within their God-appointed pathway they desire and yearn for
him. Name is shorthand for what the Lord has made known about
himself; renown, literally ‘remembrance’ (Ex. 3:15), is the
cultivated memory of what he has revealed about himself and his
deeds. The longings of the righteous are controlled by revealed
truth — and that constantly (night ... morning). One of the things
(9c should begin with ‘For’) that hold the people of God in their
obedience is the fact that the judgments of the Lord on earth
enable its people to /earn righteousness. Judgments (see 8a) are
either the law of God as obeyed by his people or the moral
disciplines of God as accepted and endured. Obedience is a
175
ISAIAH 26:10-13
telling testimony (Dt. 4:5-6), as is also a demeanour of peace
amid the frequently inexplicable providences and chastisements
of God. 10-11, Impenetrable blindness (D). God has three ‘ways’ of
showing himself to the world at large. First, there is his providing
grace (10a; Acts 14:17); secondly, there is the granting of
favourable circumstances: a land of uprightness or ‘straightforwardness’, when life is all ‘plain sailing’; thirdly, there are
signal acts of God, in blessing or bane, when his hand is lifted
high for all to see. But no matter what God does, it is met with incomprehension (do not learn), stubbornness (go on doing evil),
and blindness of spirit (do not see). Sometimes there seems to be
a dawning spiritual awareness, but it fades because the majesty of the LORD has not been acknowledged. Let them see is a fair translation but not so suited to context as ‘they shall see’. It is a
fact — and not one that any would desire — that, some day, those
who now refuse to learn will see (11cd) and will come under judgment (llef). The contrast between your people and your enemies gives point to Isaiah’s teaching. The world continued in ignorance when it might have learned. They not only failed to acknowledge God in his majesty but failed to see what their
position and choice involved, a relationship of present enmity
with eternal consequences. Fire: the symbol of the active,
consuming holiness of God (Ex. 3:2; cf. Is. 6:6; 30:27; 33:14;
66:24).
12-15, The divinely ordained peace (C2; cf. Cl, 7-9). If,
then, the people of the world, the unconverted, are of such
impenetrable obstinacy and blindness as verses 10—11 insist, how
does such an entity as the Lord’s people come to exist at all? The
answer is that the same Lord who (7-9) ordains their life’s
experiences has ordained their entrance into his peace and has
done everything that is necessary to bring them there.
12. First, you establish peace. Establish (Sapat) means ‘to put
something in place’ (2 Ki. 4:38), ‘to appoint someone to some
experience’ (Ps. 2:15), hence ‘you make peace our portion’. All
that we ... is (lit.) ‘For indeed all our works you have done for
us’. An identical piece of Hebrew in 2 Chronicles 4:6 allows us
to translate ‘all our works’ as ‘whatever concerns us’. It is only if the Lord undertakes ‘everything that concerns us’ that our incomprehension, perversity and blindness of spirit can be overcome. Salvation has to be all of God. _ 13. Secondly, the Lord not only does all to bring his people into a relationship of peace with himself (12) but also it is he who keeps them there. Your name alone: this unqualified assertion of
176
ISAIAH 26:14-19
loyalty is at variance with the recorded history of the Lord’s
people — then as now — and the literal translation must be
restored: ‘only by you do we keep your name in remembrance’.
The other lords included Pharaoh in Egypt, the alien rulers
during the time of the Judges, the Philistines, and in Isaiah’s day
the Assyrians, but throughout all this there was one faithful God
preserving a people to keep his name, the truth of his selfrevelation, in remembrance. Fidelity to him is his gift.
14-15. The work of God remains; the other lords have
evaporated. Departed spirits: ‘shadowy ones’ (see 14:9). Punished: ‘visited’ (see 24:21). Such complete oblivion must be an
act of God. But, thirdly, while the other lords vanished even from
memory, the nation increased. This also is the Lord’s doing,
Glory for yourself: it was not for their worthiness that he
increased his people, but for himself, ‘for his own name’s sake’.
16-19, Out of the dust (B2; cf. B1, 5-6). In B1 the Lord will
bring his foes down into the dust, but, fourthly, he has the
opposite in mind for people he proposes to gather to himself.
What the Lord has done for them already (12-15) stands in
contrast with what they have achieved for him (16-18) but this
does not divert him. As he has done all for them (12), so he will
by-pass their failures and (19) bring people out of the dust into a
fresh, new morning.
16. The book of Judges is a good commentary with its
recurring bouts of apostasy followed by penitence (Jdg. 2:11—19).
Came to you is ‘visited’, never elsewhere used of people coming
to God; they ‘paid you attention’. Barely ...: the Hebrew is as
well translated by ‘barely whisper a prayer’ as we can manage in
the present state of knowledge. The Hebrew relates this (not as
NIV to ‘discipline’ but) to their distress: it was a sorrowing,
desperate return to him. And, crushed as they were, he did not
reject them.
17. They (16) becomes we. The story becomes contemporary,
and were we should be ‘we have been’. Isaiah is thinking of the
Assyrian crisis and all the suffering it brought, the enslavement
of northern Israel and the trauma in Judah. It has all been agony
like childbirth. Jn your presence: ‘because of you’, i.e. because of
the just divine ordering of life as the arena of his chastisements
10:5—15). 18. Travail in birth brings a positive result, but in this case the
pain produced nothing. They knew the world needed to learn
righteousness (9) and should do so through them (9), but, looking
around, they have brought no birth into salvation. 19. The meaning of this verse is disputed, some seeing here
177
ISAIAH 26:20-21
nothing more than the resurrection of the community,' but, first,
the (mere) continuance of the community as such does not meet
the problems that the poem describes. The world has not come to
new birth. The continuance of the community does nothing to
solve this. Secondly, relating this passage to its parallel in verses
5-6, it is the inhabitants of the ‘lofty city’ who dwell in the dust.
The Lord’s people already inhabit the city of salvation (1). It is
others who need to be drawn in. In this connection your dead is
more likely to mean ‘the dead you are concerned about’ and this
is then capped by the Lord’s claim upon them as (lit.) ‘my
corpses’ (not as NIV), i.e. ‘the dead I am concerned with’. It is,
then, a promise of life for the world: the counterpart of the vision
of 25:6-10a. But 25:7-8 looked forward specifically to the abolition of death itself. If we view 26:19 in its context in this
way (as indeed we must), then its terms go beyond any figurative significance to the literal sense of a full resurrection.’ The call to
wake up to joy is illustrated by the two figures of dew and
morning or ‘full light’. Dew is symbolic of heaven’s contribution
to earthly well-being (Gn. 27:28, 39; Dt. 33:13, 28), royal favour
(Pr. 19:12) and divine blessing (Ho. 14:5). It is linked with the
manna in Exodus 16:13-14 (cf Nu. 11:19), the divine gift which
cancelled the threat of death (Ex. 16:3). Morning: literally ‘lights’, a plural of amplitude, ‘full light’. Death is darkness; light
is life (Jb. 3:16; Pss. 49:19; 56:13) and salvation (Ps. 27:1; cf. 2
Sa. 23:4; Ps. 104:2; Is. 9:2; 59:9; 60:1, 3). In the parallel oracle (18:4), the Lord’s presence is dew and light. As the dew
descends, so he will come to the dead he is concerned with, Pepe = Vitality, salvation. Her dead: ‘its shadowy ones’ (see
20-21, Secure from wrath (A2; cf. Al, 1-4). The poem began
with ‘open the gates’ (2); it ends with shut the doors. This looks
1E. J. Kissane, The Book of Isaiah (Browne and Nolan, 1960), finds here only
a reference to ‘national resurrection’. H. H. Rowley, The Faith of Israel (SCM,
1956), p. 1160, says the passage represents a stage en route to individual
resurrection. Skinner, /saiah, and Herbert, Isaiah ] — 39, find the promise of individual resurrection.
2 Cf Dn. 12:2. The evolutionary supposition that OT thought progressed from poor beginnings to brilliant endings has led to the conclusion that this doctrine of death and resurrection must be late. How insubstantial is all this! The Egyptians had an intricate theology of life after death centuries before Isaiah. Even Canaanite religion, for all its brutishness, depended on the annual triumph of Baal over death. In the name of all logic, how could Israel, with its foundational belief in the living God, lack, within revealed religion, what others arrived at by wishful 1960),¢ a natural religion? See especially J. Mauchline, Jsaiah 1 — 39 (SCM, ) p. 193.

ISAIAH 27:1
back to the shutting of the door of the ark (Gn. 7:1, 16) and
entering indoors at the Passover (Ex. 12:22-23). In times of his
just judgment, the Lord makes provision for his people. In verses
1 their security in the strong city was in the context (5-6) of
the doom of the world city. In that day they will be as safe as in
the ark or inside the blood-marked homes (Ex. 12-13). Passed by
is the ‘pass over’ verb of Exodus 12:12, 23. This sheltering
security is necessary, ‘For’ (the opening word of 21) the Lord is
emerging to punish (‘visit’, 24:21). Sins (‘dw6n): see 1:4; 6:7, the
internal reality of sin in the fallen nature. Blood shed: the most
flagrant outward violation of God’s law. Disclose: even longhidden sin — which the perpetrators thought was forgotten — will
be exposed. The earth itself takes action, co-operating with the
Creator: this is its “moral vitality’. It has been infected by human
sin but has never ceased to identify with the holiness of its God
(1:2-3; 24:5; cf Gn. 4:10-12).
v. The universal Israel (27:1-13). With this passage we reach
the conclusion of Isaiah’s panorama of history. Its‘ companion
passages (see pp. 110-111) are 19:1-25 and 23:1-18 with the
shared theme of the worldwide people (19:24—25; 23:18; 27:12-
13). Within the Isaiah Cantata (chs. 24 — 27) this is the
denouement: in 26:20-21 the believing people, though within the
city of salvation, were waiting for the final coming of the Lord in
judgment. This is now envisaged. 27:1—13 consists of a central
passage (7-11), dealing with past forbearance (7-8), coming
atonement (9) and ultimate overthrow (10-11). On each side of it
there are two ‘in that day’ sections (1 and 2-6; 12 and 13). These
match each other: the Lord’s victory in the heavenlies (1) and the
Lord’s jubilee on earth (13); the vineyard people (2-6) and the
harvested people (12). Thus (exactly as 14:1-2 is central to 13:1
— 14:27 in the opening oracle of the series) the Lord’s plans for
his people lie at the centre of his cosmic, eschatological work.
1, The Lord’s victory in the heavenlies: the great sword.
Isaiah not infrequently used pagan mythological concepts illustratively (see 51:9) without subscribing to their truth. In this
fourth in that day elaboration (see pp. 167-168), Leviathan is a
water-beast, real or imagined (Jb. 41:1; Ps. 104:26); in Psalm
74:14 it is figurative of Egypt; and in Job 3:8 to ‘awaken Leviathan’ is to bring into operation disruptive supernatural forces.
Leviathan stands for immense power, including supernatural
power(s) ranged against the Creator God. Here, however, the
mystery-name Leviathan modulates into the factual serpent and
points to these forces as created. Monster (tannin) can be a sea
179
ISAIAH 27:2-6
creature (Gn. 1:21), a serpent or crocodile (Ex. 7:9; Ps. 91:13), or
figurative of what possesses overwhelming power (Je. 51:34).
Coiling may be factual (twisting) or moral (twisted) or both.
Serpent is nahds, as in Genesis 3:1, and is doubtless used here for
that reason. The threefold description Leviathan ... serpent ...
monster is matched by the threefold description of the Lord’s
sword: fierce (hard, unrelenting), great (equal to any task) and
powerful (dominating). Hostile supernatural forces infest the
whole creation, coiling on land, monstrous in the sea. Thus has
sin corrupted the ‘very good’ work of God (Gn. 1:31), but, however great and wherever concealed, the sword of the Lord
will find and slay them in that day. 2-6, The vineyard people. This final song in the cantata of
chapters 24 — 27 matches the vineyard song in 5:1—7. There the
emphasis was on what the Lord’s people made of his vineyard;
here it is on what the Lord will make of them.
2. They are the Lord’s delight. /n that day: the fifth elaboration
(see pp.167—168). Fruitful vineyard is either ‘vineyard of delight’
or, in some MSS, ‘vineyard of foaming wine’. The former contrasts with the hostility of 5:5—6; the latter with the undrinkable
wine of 5:2, 4.
3. They are under the Lord’s care. Here is a total divine work:
conserving (watch over, ‘preserve’) its excellence, nourishing
(water), and protecting (guard is the same verb as watch over but
here looking outward against intruders). All this care is
continually ... day and night.
4. The Lord is at peace. J am not is (lit.) ‘I have no anger’;
héma is angry feeling. Isaiah 5:5—6 and 26:3, 12, spoke of peace
enjoyed by believers; here, peace is in the heart of God. Jf only:
the Lord longs for a chance to show his zeal for his vineyard; just let a weed appear!
5. The Lord invites the hypothetical weeds of verse 4 to come
to me for refuge. Vineyard membership is open to all, as once to
Moab (see 16:5). 6. The Lord promises that the divinely nurtured vineyard will fill the earth (Ps. 80). Jn days to come may be a correct interpretation of ‘the coming ones’. But as an exclamation, ‘They are coming!’, it might refer to those responding to the invitation of verse 5. Fill all the world [i.e. ‘fill the face of the earth’] with fruit: the wording is exactly the same as ‘cover the earth [i.e. “fill the face of the earth”] with their cities’ (14:21). Babylon’s plan was to organize the whole world without reference to God. But i ae has a different intention and one that will be fulfilled
180
ISAIAH 27:7-11
7-11, The work of the Lord. How will all this happen? First, the Lord has never been as harsh with Israel as with Israel’s foes
(7-8), and this same mercy will display itself in atonement (9a),
issuing in a religiously purged people (9b-f); secondly, the Lord
will destroy the fortified city (10-11; 25:1—-5; 26:5—6).
—8. The Hebrew in verse 7 is rhythmic and beautiful but at
the expense of clarity! ‘Like the smiting of the one who smote
him did he smite him?’, i.e. did the Lord smite Israel to the same
extent as he smote Israel’s smiters? The second question is much
the same: ‘or like the slaughter of his slaughtered ones was he
slaughtered?’, ie. did Israel ever suffer such casualties as the
Lord inflicted on those he defeated (as, e.g., 37:36)? By warfare:
Sa’ssa@’ is otherwise unknown (NIV has followed the surmise of
LXX), but cognate languages suggest a verb ‘to cry sa-sa’, ‘to
scare off by shouting’ — as we say, ‘to shoo away’. This matches
exile, which means ‘by sending off’ — not a reference to the
Babylonian exile only but to all occasions when an enemy
invaded and took prisoners. On all such occasions, divine wrath
could have exacted a full penalty from Israel but forbearance
intervened — and even when the major exile came, it was
cushioned with a promise of return. Chastisement was truly his
fierce blast, never negligible, for divine wrath is real and divine
standards non-negotiable.
9. By this looks back to the point just made: the Lord has ever
acted with restraint, preserving his people when they merited
death. Then: ‘therefore’; the same principle of divine action will
apply in atonement. Guilt (‘aw6n): see 5:18; 6:7; 26:21; 53:5.
Atoned (Nkapar): see 6:7. The Lord will pay the atonement
(covering) price for the sinful nature (guilt) and for the removal
of his sin (hatta’ t), his actual wrongdoing (5:18; 6:7; 53:12), and
this will be seen in its full fruitage when those atoned for destroy
the altar and remove the poles. The altar represents all
expressions of religion authorized by the Lord, and poles and
incense altars stand for illegitimate and imported religious
usages. First, then, there will no longer be need for an altar for
sacrifice (Heb. 10:12, 18) and Jacob will acknowledge this by
even grinding its stones to pieces like so much chalk. Secondly,
the atonement will purge out erroneous religious practice.
Asherah poles: see 17:8. Incense altars is probably a correct
translation of hammdnim (Ezk. 6:4ff.). It is not the word for the
authorized incense altar (Ex. 39:38) but is linked with Baal (2 Ch.
14:5) and ‘high places’ (Lv. 26:30).
10-11. Isaiah, then (9), has not forgotten the atonement-base
on which this whole division (chs. 6 — 37) of his book rests (6:7),
181
ISAIAH 27:12-13
but, just as he went on in chapters 7ff. to the ‘royal’ theme of
conquest, so he does here. The reference to the city links this
oracle in particular to the world city and its fall (25:1-5; 26:56).
Isaiah does not explain how it will be, but the coming atonement
(9) will be the occasion for the fall of the fortified city, with the
motif of incoming animals (10), as ever, speaking of the end of
human occupation. The browsing animals leave bare twigs, but
(11) even they disappear as firewood. For introduces the cause of
such a total judgment: lack of understanding (cf. 26:10) has led
to forfeiture of divine compassion and favour (Rom. 1:28; Eph. 4:18-19). Understanding is a plural of amplitude (binét, 1:3), ‘true discernment’. Compassion (Vraham, 13:18; 14:1) is
typically the love of a mother for her child. Favour (Vhanan) is
‘grace’, the undeserved kindness of God (Gn. 6:8; Ps. 51:1). Creator is ‘Potter’, ‘he who moulded them’ (Gn. 2:7). This richness of maternal love is forfeited by sin — specifically, that of the mind failing to exercise its power to perceive, grasp and hold the
th.
12-13, The jubilee harvest: the great trumpet. Two in that
day oracles form the sixth elaboration (see pp. 167-168), and
they conclude just as they began. The first (12) is (like 2-6) a
picture of sowing and reaping; the second (13) with its great
trumpet of gathering matches the ‘great sword’ (1) of victory.
12. The Lord gathers his harvest one by one. In that day: see p.
168. Thresh: Vhabat does mean this (Jdg. 6:11), but is also used
of gathering olives by beating (Dt. 24:20), which suits the one by
one emphasis. The flowing Euphrates and the Wadi of Egypt were
the traditional boundaries of the promised land (Gn. 15:18; Ex.
23:31) and here represent the gathering up by the Lord of every
true member of his people, ‘the sons of Israel’.
13. The fiftieth (Jubilee) year (Lv. 25:8ff.) followed the fortyninth (sabbatical) year and was, therefore, a year for which there
was no harvest in preparation. Thus it was a year of total
dependence on the Lord. As in 25:6—10a, in that day the Lord
will supply everything (55:1-2; Lk. 14:17). The Jubilee trumpet
was sounded on the Day of Atonement (Lv. 25:9), linking with
the atonement in verse 9. Great trumpet: cf. Zechariah 9:14; Matthew 24:31; 1 Corinthians 15:52; 1 Thessalonians 4:16. Assyria ... Egypt: the reference is to those living within Gentile boundaries, the ingathering of the world. Exiled (Vnddé) is used of Israelites driven from their land (8:22), but it is used also in the general sense of ‘straying’ (Dt. 22:1), people homeless before the enemy (16:34). The thought is not of ‘exile’ from the land of Israel but of being harassed and distraught in a spiritually alien
182
ISAIAH 28 — 37
environment (Ps. 120). But all such will at last experience the
wonder of 19:24-25. Egypt ... Assyria: just as eschatological
judgments fall on real people (e.g. Moab, 25:10), so do eschatological blessings. Isaiah relates the eschaton to the world map
he knows, and even from the supreme oppressors’ grasp (Egypt
the first, Assyria the contemporary) there will be those whom the
trumpet calls to liberty and home to Zion. All together will
worship the LORD on the holy mountain, full participants in the
holy community, and in Jerusalem, citizens of the strong city (Eph. 3:6).
IV. THE LORD OF HISTORY (28 — 37)
These chapters form the greatest of Isaiah’s ‘interim fulfilments’
(see, e.g., 14:24-27; 20:1-6; 23:17-18). Having listened to his
teaching in chapters 13 — 27 that ‘in that day’ the whole world
will be one people, acknowledging one God and worshipping
him alone, Isaiah’s discipleship group (8:16) must surely have
asked the question that springs to our lips: is this wishful thinking
or a serious reality? In any event, this is the question Isaiah
answers in chapters 28 — 37.
The reference to Israel, Egypt and Assyria in 27:12—13 forms
the bridge into this new section, which reflects a period of history
in which these three powers tangled with each other — a period,
that is to say, which offered a test case of the Lord’s rule in
history and specifically over the three powers Isaiah has used as
eschatological symbols. The occasion was the ‘Egyptian Alliance’ (Introduction, pp. 18-19) in the days of Hezekiah. Assyria
was the overlord; Hezekiah a puppet ‘king’ under Assyria;
Merodach-Baladan, the ever-restless king and would-be king of
Babylon, was canvassing an alliance with the western Palestinian
states; and Egypt was covenanting intervention once the flag of
rebellion was raised. In chapters 38 — 39 Isaiah will diagnose this
as an issue of faith, and he does not ignore that great question
here, for it was his task to oppose Hezekiah’s lunatic fascination
with militarist solutions by asserting the alternative course of
trusting God’s promises. But in the main in these chapters, the
issue of faith is in the background, and he takes us through the
events in order to reveal where power really lies, that is to say, in
the sovereign Lord.
The section falls into two parts: first, there is a series of six
‘woe’ passages (28 — 35; see 28:1; 29:1, 15; 30:1; 31:1; 33:1);
and, secondly, chapters 36 — 37 recount the history of Sennacherib and Jerusalem in 701 BC. The arrangement of the six
183
ISAIAH 28: 1-4
‘woes’ is important. We shall note as we work through them that
they match each other in pairs (the first and the fourth, second
and fifth, third and sixth) but there is also, so to speak, a “storyline’. In chapters 28 — 29 no names of outside nations are
mentioned, even though the intrigues leading up to the Egyptian
Alliance can be read between the lines. The purpose of these
chapters (like 1 — 5) is to elucidate principles of divine working
in history. Chapters 30 — 32 come to grips with events. We meet
Egypt and Assyria by name, and yet the more Isaiah involves himself in the realities of historical events the more easily he
moves off into eschatology (as in chs. 7 — 11), so that we view
the fall of Assyria side by side with the messianic kingdom. Finally, chapters 33 — 35 are wholly eschatological (like 24 — 27):
the coming of the king (33); cosmic victory (34); and the
pilgrimage of the redeemed to Zion (35).
a. The six woes (28:1 — 35:10)
i. The first woe: the word of God and the purposes of God
(28:1-29). There are three sections woven together here into a
unity of presentation. Isaiah starts with a message he prepared
regarding Samaria (1-6) before the city fell in 722 BC. This is
made the basis of a comparison with Jerusalem (7—22) at the time
the Egyptian Alliance was being negotiated. Then Isaiah adopts
the style of a ‘wisdom’ writer and meditates on the discerning
ways of the Lord (23-29).
Samaria: a surprising hope (28:1-6). The hill of Samaria (1
Ki. 16:24), crowned by the city, is pictured as a garlanded
reveller whose time is up (1). As forcefully as a storm (2-3), as
instantaneously as swallowing a ripe fig (4), the Lord will destroy
Samaria. But the crown of the reveller will be replaced by a true
crown (5), and the city that fell so easily will become wise (6ab),
strong (6c) and impregnable (6d).
1. Woe (hoy) can be a summons (55:1), an expression of anger
(1:24) or of sympathy (1 Ki. 13:33). The idea throughout this
series is of a summons to the bar of judgment. Samaria is charged
directly not with dissoluteness (cf Am. 4:1; 6:6), but with the pride which led them into complacent revelry. But the flower is fading; the party is almost over. 2-4. Two illustrations from nature depict the total destruction of the city. The first is the storm, with hail, wind and (lit.) ‘downpour of water, mighty flooding’. The Lord (?“donay) stresses the divine sovereignty. One who is veils the name (Assyria) of the coming conqueror, for Isaiah is concerned here with principles behind events, not the events themselves. Thus,
184
ISAIAH 28:5-8
wherever pride leads people into moral indifference and a life of
mere this-worldly indulgence, the Sovereign has at his disposal
the means of overthrow. The second illustration is of a walker
who sees an early fig ready for eating and with one unthinking
movement it is picked and eaten. Swallows, used literally in the
illustration, is often figurative of total disappearance (3:12; 25:7—
8). The first illustration, then, is the power with which Samaria
will be destroyed; the second is the ease and totality of its
destruction. Behind it all on the one hand is a truly sovereign
God, whose total mastery of the most potent forces of nature is
but an illustration of his mastery of the forces of history; behind it on the other hand is the single sin of pride.
5—6. Often in Isaiah hope comes as a surprise. No sooner has
Samaria disappeared, been submerged (2) and swallowed (4) by
judgment, than a day is envisaged when it will be transformed.
Here, then, is another principle at work: the Lord brings just
judgments (1-4) but never rewrites his promises (5-6). The
words crown, glorious, beautiful are the same as in verse 1 but
here linked with the Lord. He will, in and through himself, undo
all that sin has done. Remnant: see 8:9-22; 10:20—23. Verse 6
takes up the picture of military overthrow in verses 2-4. Where
they were once weak and vulnerable there will be transformation:
first, a true king. Justice and judgment are the same word,
meaning ‘a right judgment in all things’, the ability to ‘set things
to rights’, the truly kingly quality predicted for the coming Zion
in 1:26. The implication is the reversal of the schism (1 Ki. 12)
between the two kingdoms and the restoration of the throne of
David. Secondly, there will be security. Strength is ‘warrior
strength’, power against the enemy. Gate: the decisive element in
city defence. If the gate yielded the city fell. This is the ‘strong
city’ motif of 26:1. Jerusalem: the inescapable word (28:7-22). There is a
sinister parallel between Jerusalem (these also, 7) and Samaria.
In Samaria, dissoluteness arose from pride; in Jerusalem gross
sensual indulgence (7-8) issues in the dismissal of the word of
the Lord. This is an acute diagnosis of the human condition:
self-satisfaction becomes self-indulgence and issues in selfsufficiency. 7-8. The verses read as if Isaiah were watching an actual
scene — and the Hebrew he writes itself captures the lurching,
staggering — and vomiting — of the revellers. Had the ambassadors of 30:1ff. returned, waving their piece of paper, gleeful
over the Egyptian Alliance (see 18), and is this the celebratory
state banquet? Even the official organs of the word of God have
185
ISAIAH 28:9-13
succumbed. Prophets were the immediate mediators of divine
revelation (visions); priests applied this truth to people’s lives in
their decisions (Mal. 2:5—7), but what they are in private (7cde)
they are in ministry (7fg). Bodily indulgence saps spiritual
perception. Befuddled is ‘swallowed up’ (see 4). They thought
they were doing the swallowing! ai
In verses 9-13, again it seems as if an actual scene is being —
recorded: the revellers round on the watching prophet. They
mock his ministry as childish (9-10), and he replies (11-13) that
what they despise as childish is but the childlike clarity of the
inescapable word of God. 9-10. Weaned ... taken: children of pre-school or play-school
age! To the sophisticated politicians, living in what they would
have called ‘the real world’, what relevance has Isaiah’s call to
rest in God (12) and to stand by faith on his promises (16)? The
‘wisdom’ which counts strength in battalions cannot find room
for prayer and faith. Do ... rule are respectively saw and qaw.
The former could be a noun from Vsdwd, ‘to command’; the
latter means ‘line’ (1 Ki. 7:23). The mockers could therefore be
picturing Isaiah as a patient teacher of children, building truth
upon truth, one bit at a time, a Jittle here, a little there.
11-13. It is possible, however, that the words do ... rule (10)
are intentionally meaningless, the reassuring noises made to a
baby. This fits with Isaiah’s reply (11). Do they think his ministry
is a meaningless jumble of noises? That is exactly what they will
hear — in the mouths of foreign invaders! For, come what may,
God will speak, but when the simple intelligibility of the word of
God is refused, his judgment falls on his professing people in the
shape of the unintelligible (1 Cor. 14:20ff.).
‘Rest and repose (12), which 30:15 spells out as returning to
and resting in the Lord, is the childlike simplicity which they
called childish irrelevance. Isaiah insists that faith is the solution
to even the harshest problems and severest threats. They would
not listen: the Hebrew goes beyond the thought of merely
refusing to listen to some particular message; it implies ‘listening
was something they were unwilling to do’. Theirs was a basic unreadiness to bow before the voice of God. The refused simplicity (10) becomes the unintelligible babble of violent and dominant conquerors (13). To reject the word of God is not to escape it. Verses 14-19 draw conclusions from 9-13. Since the word of God must and will have its way, therefore (14) no human arrangements for security can succeed (14-15); the Lord has made true safety available (16) and he will allow no rival
186
ISAIAH 28:14-19
possibilities (17). Even now the invitation to hear the word (14)
and to adopt a position of trust (16) remains, but outside that
invitation there is no salvation.
14-15. Scoffers (Viis): people far gone in cynical dismissal of
spiritual truth (Ps. 1:1; Pr. 14:9), self-assured (Pr. 1:22), beyond
correction (Pr. 13:1), arrogant (Pr. 21:24). Isaiah puts words into
their mouths (15) which spell out the implications of what they
actually said. Covenant and agreement point to the alliance with
Egypt, supposedly guaranteeing success in rebellion against
Assyria. They would have spoken of a covenant with Pharaoh, an
agreement with Egypt, but to Isaiah it was signing their own
death warrant! The overwhelming scourge, a mixed metaphor of
flogging and drowning, refers to Assyrian invasion (see 8:6-8).
Did they say, ‘Should Assyria invade ...’? Isaiah rephrased their
words: you won’t escape the whip, you can’t escape the flood!
Lie ... falsehood: the former (kdzab, 58:11) is the deceitful
contrasted with the reliable; the latter (Seger, 2 Ki. 9:12) is
untruth contrasted with the truth. So much, said Isaiah, for
Egypt’s promises!
16. So recapitulates the therefore of verse 14. The affirmation
there of what the Lord said is amplified here by what he has done
(cf 1 Pet. 2:4-8a). A stone in Zion: the stone could be the Lord
himself, who chose and came to dwell in Zion (8:14); or it could
be the Davidic throne as the focus of the promises (Pss. 2:6;
118:22); or we could translate ‘a stone, namely Zion’: the chosen
city as the repository of the presence and promises of God. But
the essential idea remains the same: promises have been made
and the Lord’s people are invited to build their lives on them.
Tested (lit. ‘a stone of testing’) is either a stone which has undergone tests — and is therefore reliable — or one which tests whether
they will take it as their foundation or turn elsewhere. Dismayed
(Vhiis) occurs twenty times in Isaiah, always with the sense of
‘hurrying’. Here it means ‘all haste and no speed’, being in a ‘flap’ — in contrast to the repose of the way of faith (12; 7:4;
30:15). 17-19. Measuring line and plumb-line are respectively the
tests of horizontal and vertical exactitude. When the Lord acts he
will do so with precision, enforcing the principles of his
holiness (righteousness) and applying them correctly (justice; cf.
1:21). Storm (hail) and flood (water ... overflow) may seem
indiscriminate, but not so. The judgment falls with exact justice.
Refuge ... hiding-place ... covenant ... agreement: the Lord will
not tolerate human alternatives to his way of salvation.
Overwhelming scourge ... beaten down: Isaiah mixes the
187
ISAIAH 28:20-26
metaphor a little more; beaten down is ‘a place for trampling’ —
the flood, the whip and the marauding beast! This is the
inescapable doom on human expedience in the place of divine
promises. ;
20-22. The section ends with two explanations (20 and 21
both begin with ‘For’) why terror awaits them, and a final appeal (22). First, they refused the Lord’s proffered rest (12). They have made their own bed and they must lie on it — but they will discover that human provisions are inadequate. The bed is too
short to stretch out on ...: the whole arrangement is without comfort or adequacy. Secondly, all the conquering power the
Lord once used on their behalf will be turned against them: the
Lord’s coming is strange, an alien task. Perazim and Gibeon look back to 2 Samuel 5:17—25 and 1 Chronicles 14:8-17. The Lord secured David on the throne by signal defeats of the Philistines.
This was the stepping-stone to national security and the establishment of Zion. But the deepest result of turning from the
word of God is to excite divine enmity. Those who rejected the
divine promises located in Zion (16) would find that their portion
is wrath on the same scale. Thirdly, there is a final appeal.
Mocking looks back to scoffers (14), both deriving from Vis.
Chains ... heavier: choices form character, for good or ill. If they
continue in cynical disregard of the Lord, they will come to the
point beyond which reformation is impossible. Sinners become
the architects of their own doom by continuing thoughtlessly in
wrong choices. Reformation is also always urgent, because the
Lord will not endlessly delay the destruction decreed. The only
way to flee from God is to flee to him.
The discriminating Lord (28:23-29). How then are we to
understand the future for Jerusalem? This first woe hinges on the
comparison between Samaria (1-6) and Jerusalem (7ff.). In the
case of Samaria, judgment (1-4) suddenly became unexpected
hope (5-6). Is there hope for Jerusalem too? Or is the decreed
destruction (22) the Lord’s last word? Isaiah answers with two
agricultural parables (an inclusio with the two natural illus- trations in 2, 4): 23-26 is a parable of sowing; 27-29, a parable of reaping.
23-26. The harsh breaking up activity of ploughing and harrowing is purposeful: it is an essential preliminary to planting and sowing. The verbs sow, scatter, plant indicate discriminating action; each seed is dealt with appropriately and also put in its place (or, maybe, ‘in rows’), in its plot and field, that is, given an environment good for growth. All this is God’s instruction and teaching (26).
188
ISAIAH 28:27-29
27-29. Isaiah draws no conclusion from his observation that
the purposeful ways of the farmer have been taught him by God,
but the ‘For’ with which verse 27 should begin indicates that the
point made in his parable of sowing is explained in the parable of
reaping. The sledge, cartwheel, rod and stick were methods of
gathering different crops. The sledge was a heavy wooden
platform, studded underneath with sharp stones or metal and
weighted on top, dragged to and fro to break up corn ready for
winnowing. Grain, of course, must be ground. That is unavoidable, brutal though it seems, for otherwise there is no harvest, but
the process is not for ever. Done to excess it would destroy the
grain. This also comes from the LORD, but it goes beyond merely
showing how agriculturists work. It reveals that the Lord is
wonderful in counsel and magnificent in wisdom. Wonderful (6:6)
means what is beyond the human, supernatural. Wisdom (tistyya;
Jb. 5:12; 6:13; Pr. 8:14; Mi. 6:9) is foresight to plan ahead, therefore the wisdom that achieves results.
It is with this thought, then, that we move from the first woe
(28:1—29) to the second (29:1—14). Jerusalem (like Samaria) will
be ploughed and crushed. The Lord’s wheels and horses will go
over it. But it is all purposeful; the crushing will be restricted
within the limits essential to the crop the Lord envisages.
ii. The second woe: is anything too hard for the Lord?
(29:1-14). Since this ‘woe’ is a double message of hope —
eleventh-hour deliverance (1-8) and coming spiritual transformation (9-14) — woe is not the most suitable translation. It is a
summons to Ariel (1, 2, 7) to grasp two great truths: no problem
is so far gone as to be insoluble to the Lord (1-8), and this applies spiritually as well as circumstantially (9-14). The same
Lord who acts in judgment acts in transformation. He brings
Ariel into the dust (1-4) and visits with spiritual coma those who
have chosen blindness (9-12), but he also disperses the foe in his
moment of triumph (5-8) and acts supernaturally to reverse
wrongful understandings (13-14). Can it be, then, that Samaria
faces both calamity and hope (28:1-6) and that the destruction
decreed against Jerusalem is controlled by the purposeful, fruitful
work of God (28:7—22, 23-29)? Yes indeed, for the Lord is never
defeated by any foe (1-8): he controls even the most threatening
catastrophes. Nor is he baffled by the intransigence of the human
heart: he is the Lord of transformation (9-14).
Chastening and deliverance (29:1-8). Behind these verses
we discern the events of chapters 36 — 37, the triumphalist
advance of Sennacherib and his ‘last-minute’ destruction. Yet
189
ISAIAH 29:1-9
Assyria is not named, and Zion is veiled behind Ariel — though its
identity is no secret (1, 8). For Isaiah’s purpose is to use events to
elucidate principles: the Lord is sovereign in history; he has the
last word and it is the word of deliverance. His people may be
humbled by the foe but they are never forsaken or destroyed (2
Cor. 4:8-10).
1-3. Ariel means ‘altar-hearth’ (Ezk. 43:15), the place of the
ever-burning fire (Lv. 6:12-13). It was both the privilege (Ps.
84:34) and the peril (Is. 33:14) of Zion to live with this fire,
alike a danger to sinners (6:4) and the means of their salvation
(6:67). It was the sign of the Lord’s indwelling presence. Isaiah
could hardly have chosen a more suitable cryptic title: Zion, the
place of holy wrath and divine preservation. David: this, then, is
the ‘strange’ and ‘alien task’ of 28:21. To think that sin has
brought them to the point where the Lord will assail Davids city!
Add year to year ... is designedly ambiguous. It can mean ‘add
another year to this one; let the feasts come round once more’ or
‘let the years roll on, the circling festivals come and go’. Isaiah is
not dating the calamity but affirming its certainty. Like an altar
hearth: ‘a veritable Ariel’, a place where holy wrath is centred.
Encamp ... towers ... siegeworks: the military terms imply human attackers, but Isaiah looks past them to divine agency.
4-8. What a scene of transformation! First, Ariel is reduced to
nothing in status (4ab) and strength (4cd), but suddenly its
enemies are as swiftly gone as blown chaff (5; 5:24; 17:13), as
insubstantial as a dream (7) and as disappointed of their hopes as
a sleeper on awakening (8). All this is because (6a, lit.) ‘from
Yahweh of hosts it will be visited’. As ‘Yahweh’ he is the God of
the exodus, delivering his people, destroying his enemies; as
“Yahweh of hosts’ he is and has every potentiality and power: his
mastery of the ‘forces’ of nature (6bc) is the standing illustration of his total sovereign power and rule.
Blindness and sight (29:9-14). Spiritual blindness is both
self-chosen (9b) and also a judgment of God upon the choice
made (10). It is a needless, wilful and careless refusal of truth
that lies to hand (11-12), and the Lord sees its hypocrisy and false-heartedness (13). In response he pledges further wonders, bringing human wisdom to an end (14). The parallel with verses 1-8 within one ‘woe’ suggests that the coming wonder will be a spiritual transformation, sudden, dramatic, matching the historical deliverance. 9. Did Isaiah still have Sennacherib in mind? To hesitate in the face of such a divine deliverance would surely be the point of no return in spiritual blindness! Yet it is by no means certain that all
190
ISAIAH 29:10-14
Jerusalem would see it so. Politicians could have seen Sen- nacherib’s retreat as the vindication of their Egyptian policy (37:8-9); others no doubt shrugged their shoulders and took it as
a happy chance. While we may well see this oracle in relation to
37:36-37, Isaiah is still concerned with principles rather than
events. Wilful blindness to the things of God (9ab) decreases the
chances of ever thinking clearly or finding the right way (9cd).
Stunned: Nmaha means ‘to delay, hesitate, be indecisive’ (Gn.
19:16; 43:10). Amazed: \tama can mean ‘to marvel’ (Ps. 48:5) or
‘be bewildered’ (Gn. 43:33). If we are indecisive spiritually we
condemn ourselves to bewilderment. Wilful refusal to see (blind
yourselves) induces blindness (be sightless). In 28:7-8,
intoxication promoted refusal of God’s word; here refusal of the
word promotes a mental and spiritual intoxication, befuddling the mind (drunk), confusing the life (stagger).
10-12. In 1 Kings 22:22, when Ahab determined to embrace
falsehood, divine judgment visited him with false prophets: by
the will and act of God, he got what he chose (cf 2 Thes. 2:9—
12). Determined spiritual insensitivity becomes judicial spiritual
deprivation: first, the mind loses its clarity: deep sleep, ‘a
spirit/Spirit of coma/torpor’, the mental equivalent of 1 Samuel
26:12; secondly, the means of spiritual enlightenment are removed: prophets and seers are synonyms for those whom God
has raised up to receive and communicate his word. The lesson is
driven home illustratively in verses 11-12: the person who can
read cannot be bothered to open the book; the person who cannot
read is unconcerned to find someone who can.
13. In verse 10 it was ‘the LORD’ who reacted: Yahweh loves
his people but he is not mocked (Gal. 6:7-8). Here it is the Lord
(i.e. ’“dondy, the Sovereign One) who notes that religious reality
has gone (13bcd) even though observance continues (13de).
Come near: cf. Exodus 28:43. Worship: ‘their fear of me’, the
sense of awe and reverence proper to those who approach God
(cf, 23). As the Sovereign reviews their worship, all he sees is
conformity to human rules. It is not that the Lord belittles the use
of words; but words without the heart are meaningless; and
worship is not worship (Mk. 7:6-8) unless it is based on and
responds to what God has revealed. 14. What the Lord’s new act will be we are not told. Like
the parables in 28:23-29, this verse is a bridge to the next
‘woe’ (15-24). It is, however, something supernatural (wonder,
9:6; 28:19) which will result in the negation of human
wisdom and intelligence. The former (hokm4) covers the whole
mind, acquiring knowledge, appraising, setting objectives; the
191
ISAIAH 29:15-18
latter (bind) is the ability to see to the heart of a matter, to
‘discern’.
iii. The third woe: spiritual transformation (29:15—24). The
second woe ended with an unanswered question: what wonder
does the Lord purpose in response to the culpable spiritual blindness of his people? The third woe replies not with how he will act
but with what he will achieve. Isaiah starts with the situation
needing to be remedied (15-16), the folly of the human mind
without God; he next affirms the coming transformation (17-21):
revived spiritual perception (18), and social reformation (19-21);
and he ends (22-24) by applying all this specifically to the Lord’s
people. ‘i 15-16. The background to this accusation of merely human planning which excludes God from their councils is indicated in
30:1-2, the Egyptian Alliance. But once more, Isaiah is
concerned here not with the events in which they participated but
with the principles which motivated them. To exalt the human
and exclude the divine is the reversal (16a) of all that is right and
proper. It is equivalent to saying (16b) that he is no more than we
are — the spirit of self-sufficiency — and that he has nothing to do with what we are (16cd) — the spirit of arrogance and usurpation.
It is even like saying that he is less than we are (16ef) — the spirit
of thoughtless stupidity — as if that which manifests thought, craft
and purpose should deny these attributes to their originator. It is a
denial of the Lord’s distinctiveness (like the clay), sovereignty
(did not make) and wisdom (knows nothing).
17. Note the abruptness with which this promise of
transformation is introduced. People can deny God his proper
place, but he is still the Lord. He does what he will in heaven
and earth (Ps. 135:6). He needs no permission. Jn a very short
time, as the Lord reckons time (2 Pet. 3:8), even creation itself
will be transformed. Lebanon typifies what is not the product of
human cultivation (Ps. 104:16); the fertile field is ‘garden-land’,
the product of human cultivation. But since the whole creation
is infected by human sin, nothing is as it should be. It all
needs turning upside down! What appeared as wildness will exhibit its true nature as the Creator’s perfect design; what we thought to be an ordered garden will, in retrospect, seem like wild forest!
18. The metaphors of deafness and blindness look back to 29:11, where the closed eyes and book contrast with open ears and an open book here. Isaiah speaks of new faculties and new appetites (deaf ... hear ... blind ... see), a new condition (out of
192
ISAIAH 29:19-24
... darkness) and new satisfaction in God’s book (scroll) (Eph. 5:8; 1 Thes. 5:4).
19-21. Isaiah focuses on three aspects of society to sketch the
coming transformation. First, there is unfettered practice of true
religion. The humble are the underdogs, crushed by vested
interests; the needy are those whose lack of resource makes them
necessarily pliable to the will of others, but often both words
describe those who seek to live devotedly for the Lord in a
secular society. In the coming new society, such will be free of
constraint and liberated to rejoice in the Holy One. Secondly,
society will be free of destructive, negative elements: the
unscrupulous (ruthless; 13:11; 25:3-5), the denigrators (mockers;
28:14, 22), and the trouble-makers (an eye for evil). Thirdly,
there will be a sound legal and judicial system with no false
testimony (21a) or ‘nobbling’ of witnesses (21b), nor the denial
of the protection of the courts to the innocent.
22-24. The forecast of the coming great society is now made
wider in that it is traced back to the original purposes of God, and
narrower in that it is focused exclusively on the chosen people,
Jacob. Redeemed (\pad@, 1:27) is not elsewhere used of
Abraham, but Genesis 48:16 uses the parallel Vga‘al (NIV
‘delivered’) of the Lord’s ‘guardian care’ of Jacob throughout his
chequered life. Both verbs are essentially “price-paying’ in their
meaning but can have a general sense of ‘looking after’, like our
expression ‘to bail someone out’. The reference to Abraham is
emphatic in the Hebrew, with the implication ‘Would the Lord
have made such a caring start with Abraham if he did not intend
to complete what he began?’ Jacob is pictured as an anxious
spectator of all that has happened to his descendants, but the day
will come when (lit.) ‘not now will Jacob be ashamed; not now
will his face pale’. Verse 23 begins with ‘For’ as an explanation
of Jacob’s release from anxiety. Their downward course has been
halted. Jacob’s children are also the work of my hands and that
guarantees, first, that they will assent to all that the Lord has
revealed about himself (23c): his name is, in general, what he is
in himself, but, more specifically, we do not know what it means
unless he tells us (Ex. 3:13-16) by his self-revelation. Secondly
(23d), they will live at peace with the holy God in their midst:
this is the force of the added words of Jacob. The Lord is holy in
himself (23c) and, in all his holiness, he comes to be among his
people (23d). Thirdly, their knowledge and acceptance of
revelation (23c), their recognition of God in their midst (23d),
will issue in a life of the deepest awe (23e). Stand in awe is
\V‘aras, the parent verb of the adjective ‘ruthless’ (20a). It speaks
193
ISAIAH 30:1
of acknowledging the awe-inspiring absoluteness of divine
majesty and one a trembling reverence (in Pet. 1:17-20).
Fourthly (24), individual life will be changed. Spirit is the energy
or ‘gusto’ with which life is lived. Instead of fickleness
(wayward) there will be true discernment (understanding, see
14), and instead of resentful grumbling there will be a teachable
spirit. Complain (Dt. 1:27; Ps. 106:25) means bitter refusal of the
Lord’s word, self-pitying determination to put the worst construction on things, paranoia in facing life. Jnstruction: from
Vlagah, ‘to take’, hence a ‘grasp’ of truth (Dt. 32:2; Jb. 11:4; Pr.
4:2; 7:21).
iv. The fourth woe: faithlessness and faithfulness (30:1-
33). The advent of the names Egypt (2) and Assyria (31),
bracketing the fourth woe, herald the fact that Isaiah is starting to
apply the principles of the first three woes to the events of the
time. In the first woe (28:1—29) he established that the Lord
works purposefully (28:23-29), even when the pathway lies
through disaster (28:14, 5—6), for his judgments do not revise
his promises; and that he calls his people to accept and trust his
word (28:12, 16). All this is now demonstrated in the actuality of
history. In verses 1-7 Isaiah condemns the Egyptian Alliance,
affirming that Egypt will be no help (S—7). Matching this, at the
end of the chapter (27-33) he insists that Assyria will be no
threat. In between this inclusio, verses 8-17 and 18-26 are a
balanced statement: the word of the Lord rejected (8-17) and
(18-26) the word of promise kept.
Contemporary events: Egypt no help (30:1—7). This is the
second time Isaiah has alluded to an embassy sent to Egypt to
secure the alliance. In the parallel woe, he mocked the
ambassadors coming back with their piece of signed paper
(28:14-15); now (1-5, 6-7) he watches them go on their profitless exercise (5, 6, 7).
1. Obstinate children: ‘rebellious sons’ (cf 1:2, 5, 23).
Declares (n®um): see 1:24. Alliance: masséka was translated
‘blanket’ in 28:20; the idea is of a protective covering. My Spirit:
see on 31:3. The preposition by is not expressed in the Hebrew,
but may be introduced legitimately, as in NIV. In this case (by) my Spirit is parallel to mine (‘from me’), emphasizing the lack of divine authorization. On the other hand, ‘not my Spirit’ would parallel alliance, the covering they might have had if they had not chosen otherwise. Sin upon sin: the first sin was acting without divine prompting, the second, seeking a ‘covering’ other than the divine Spirit. The first recourse of the Lord’s people,
194
ISAIAH 30:2-8
whether for wisdom or provision, is the Lord himself; any other
course is sin (hatta’t), a falling short of their true dignity.
2. Egypt is the place of death (Ex. 1:22) — and they went there
seeking life (cf 28:15)! Without consulting me: ‘and my mouth
they have not asked’, exactly as Joshua 9:14. The ‘mouth’ is the
organ of expressed, personal opinion. If they had asked he would
have spoken. But their eyes (Jook) were elsewhere.
3-5. The synonyms shame and disgrace do not exclude
‘feeling embarrassed’ but they emphasize ‘reaping shame’,
objective disappointment of hope. Zoan was in the northern Delta
and Hanes south of Memphis. The officials may be those of
Pharaoh, indicating that the ‘Ethiopian Dynasty’ of Shabako had
extended its power all over lower Egypt. In this case Isaiah is
alluding to the supposition that such a ruler would be worth
cultivating. Alternatively, the reference may be to Judah’s
officials and envoys, trailing from one centre of influence to
another in the hope of securing Pharaoh’s aid. Either way, it is all
useless, bringing neither help nor advantage. ‘Well, of course!’
Isaiah might have said, for from the feared killer (Assyria) they
were seeking help from the proved killer (Egypt)!
6~7. The separate heading in verse 6 indicates a separate poem
— of beautifully crafted, sharp, compulsive Hebrew — which
Isaiah publicized (see 8) to drive the message home. The cryptic
title would excite interest and provoke questions (cf 8:1). In
verses 1—5 Isaiah emphasized the merely human planning that lay
behind the Egyptian embassy; here, the sacrificial human cost.
But no matter what wisdom we exercise or labour we expend, we
cannot be the authors of our own security. The animals: what
irony! The question in every mouth was, ‘How will our ambassadors fare?’ Isaiah said, ‘Never mind them. Think about the poor
beasts!’ Hardship ... distress: the ordinary route to Egypt lay
through Philistia. It would seem, however, that (in the interests of
secrecy?) they went through the Negeb. In Exodus 13:17 the
Lord would not let his people journey through Philistia lest
opposition turn them back to Egypt. Did the ambassadors realize
they were exactly reversing the exodus? Rahab seems to have
had currency as a nickname for Egypt (Ps. 87:4; cf 51:9). It
means ‘turbulence, boastfulness’. Perhaps ‘Big Mouth’ would
catch Isaiah’s sense! Egypt: overflowing with promises, but in the
event the Do-nothing.
The word refused (30:8—17). Isaiah reinforces the message of
coming judgment. 8. Isaiah is commanded to make a public record (tablet) and a
private one (scroll) of his ministry. What was he commanded to
195
ISAIAH 30:9-12
write down? Verses 9 and 15 begin with the Hebrew word ki,
which often means ‘that’. If this is the case here, then verses 9—
17 are what he was commanded to write — ‘that’ they have
rebelled against revealed truth (9-14) and specifically against the
call to repent (15-17). But if A@ has its meaning “for/because’,
then these verses explain why he was commanded to make a
record, and we can only guess what was recorded. The public.
tablet would presumably be a succinct statement of Isaiah’s ministry at this time: poems like verses 1-5 and 6-8 would be
easy to write up in a public place (cf 8:1) as a sort of ‘wall- newspaper’; and as for the private, written record, it would most reasonably be the full record of Isaiah’s ministry at the time of
the alliance, all that we now have in chapters 28 — 37. The tablet
is to be for them (lit. ‘among them’) where they have access to it;
the scroll or ‘book’ is to be an everlasting witness. It is the imperishable word of God; its immediate relevance did not exhaust its endless significance. Verses 9-14 give the first explanation of the people’s
situation: they have played false to the Lord (9), not by silencing
the prophets but by demanding a prophetic message to suit their
own tastes (10-11; 2 Tim. 4:3-4). The consequence will be the
collapse of the whole social fabric (12-14).
9. On the initial ‘For’ see above. Rebellious: see 1:20.
Deceitful: false, disappointing, failing to be what they ought.
Children: ‘sons’, see 1:2. Unwilling to listen: as in 28:12.
Instruction (t6ra): see on 1:10.
10-11. Isaiah explains what he meant by accusing them (9) of
unwillingness to listen. People, of course, do not openly ask to be
told what is illusory, but their actions can make their meaning
plain. As in 28:14—15, Isaiah spells out the meaning behind their
words. Pleasant means ‘smooth’; illusions comes from Vtdlal, to
mock, trifle with. Instead, therefore, of what is right, they want
things which will leave the surface of life unruffled, a ministry of
trifles; they did not want the direction or style of life (way ...
path) altered, and in particular they did not want to hear of a holy
God living among them and exerting pressure on them (of Israel; see on 1:4). They did not ask that preaching cease; only that it be innocuous, and without the absolutes of truth and morality which derive from the character of God. 12. Therefore ... the Holy One: they cannot rid themselves of the Holy God (11) by wishing it to be so! Their refusal of him Issues In a consequence: his holy opposition to them. To reject the word of the Lord is to make an enemy of the Lord of the word. Message ... oppression: they chose a new morality of
196
ISAIAH 30:13-17
‘freedom’ and did not want to be held to the Lord’s ‘way’ (11).
But all who make this false choice find that they have opted for bondage to a cruel oppression.
13-14. We need to reintroduce the ‘Therefore’ at the
beginning of verse 13. Consequences follow when the Lord’s
word is spurned. This sin is, first, self-destructive (13), like a wall
collapsing under its own weight; secondly, it provokes divine
judgment (14). Jt will break: better, ‘he will break’. Taking ...
Scooping must refer to familiar practices: using a bit of pottery to
carry a glowing ember to light another fire, or a bit of an old cup
to dip water from a tank.
Verses 15-17 give a second explanation of the people’s
situation: they have refused repentance and faith.
15. Once more the rejected Holy One (11) imposes his
unchanged character upon them, this time backed by his
sovereign (’“donday) power. Note that this verse (cf 9) begins
with ‘For’ (see 8 above). The rejection of the Lord’s word is now
specific, whereas in verses 9-14 it was general. Repentance and
rest: the word called them back to him. Repentance means
‘returning’, not a feigned return but one that would really bring
them back to rest upon him. Quietness is the absence of panic
and restlessness. It is the product not of refusal to face life but of
insistence upon taking God into account in frust. This is strength
(g°bird), specifically strength for (life’s) battle. Sadly, just as
‘they were not willing for hearing’ (9), so they would have none
of (lit. ‘they were not willing for’) repenting, believing and
finding rest and strength.
16-17. Just as they proposed an alternative morality (10-11),
so they had a militarist alternative to repentance and faith, but
they would experience the truth of Matthew 26:52. Flee ... flee ...
swift ... swift: when we refuse the way of faith, whatever we
choose as an alternative brings its own retribution on us. We
choose to flee, we will flee; we want swiftness, we get swift
enemies! Thousand ... one: the promise of Leviticus 26:8 is
reversed; the threat of Deuteronomy 32:30 is realized. Flagstaff
... banner prove there were once people around to put them there.
The evidence is left, the people are gone (6:11-12). This is the
third picture of the total destructiveness of the one ‘sin’ (13) of
rejecting the Lord’s word (cf 13-14).
The promise kept (30:18-26). The topic of this woe so far
has been human faithlessness: the faithless ‘wisdom’ which
sought Egypt’s aid (1-7), and the unbelieving spurning of the
word of the Lord (8-17). The remainder of the woe turns to the
faithfulness of God: his faithfulness to what he has promised
197
ISAIAH 30:18-22
(18-26) and his faithfulness to his undeserving people in their
moment of crisis (27-33). First, then, though they spurn his word
(8-17) he keeps his word: grace and compassion lie in readiness
(18); he will respond to prayer (19); beyond affliction lies a
readiness to hear his word of guidance (20-21) and a disgusted
rejection of false religion (22). There will be every earthly
abundance (24-25) and the renewal of creation in the day of
healing (26). Te ee 18. Yet (lakén) is ‘Therefore’, which occurs twice in this verse
(matching the double ‘therefore’ of judgment in 12-13 and 16):
‘Therefore the Lord waits ... Therefore he will rise ...” The
faithfulness with which he punishes his people for spurning his
word is the faithfulness with which he commits himself to the
word he has spoken. His necessary chastisements do not nullify
his grace; they only impose a waiting (/ongs) until the right
moment comes, for (as 28:26, 29 have indicated) the LORD is a
God of justice, better, here, ‘judgment’: judging the exact
moment at which to be gracious (Vhdnan), to act in unmerited
favour (Gn. 6:8), and to show compassion (Vraham), his
passionate, surging love for his people (14:1).
The emphasis Zion ... Jerusalem is intentional: the
promises will be kept not only at the right time (18) but in the
appointed place (28:16). Weep no more: literally ‘not weep at all’.
There will be unalloyed joy when grace and compassion manifest
themselves in the immediate attention of the Lord to the prayers
of his people (cf Jn. 16:23-24, 26-27).
20-21. Isaiah makes no secret of the reality of the time of
duress (40:1-2). The bread of adversity and the water of
affliction: these are nouns in apposition and the sense is ‘bread,
that is, adversity’, ‘adversity as your bread, affliction as your
drink’. This period of divine concealment (8:17) will lead to a
time of unclouded relationship. Teachers: the plural is _permissible but difficult to explain, for Judah’s teachers were never
hidden. The problem was not the concealment of teachers but the
unwillingness of hearers (28:9-10; 30:10-11). The form méreyka could equally well be singular, ‘your Teacher’. This makes sense: in the coming time of bliss, divine self-revelation of ‘your Teacher’ will be received and responded to. Rejection of the word of the Lord will be a thing of the past (eyes ... ears). You turn ... voice: the Lord’s people are still potential sinners but they are preserved in righteousness. The Teacher who is before their eyes is also watchfully behind them. 22. This is the necessary negative side of their positive relationship with the Lord. Separation to the Lord must show
198
ISAIAH 30:23-26
itself in separation from what is false and wrong. The care they
lavished on their idols (silver ... gold) will be replaced by
disrespect (defile), revulsion (menstrual cloth) and rejection (Away with you).
23—24. In contrast to the poverty of bread and water (20),
there is a coming abundance. This is not a materialistic vision as
such, but a vision of creation restored. Sin brought a restraint on
the in-built processes of creation (Gn. 3:17-19), but the coming
glory will see the curse removed (11:6-9; Am. 9:13). The Lord
will play his part in this new earth (23a), and earth will respond
richly (23b; Ho. 2:21-22). In contrast to the afflictive labour to
which human wisdom put them (6-7), the beasts will share the
bounty of the new creation (24). Broad meadows: they will have
wide, totally safe ranges. Fork and shovel: means of sieving
earth. Their fodder will be doubly purified for them.
25-26. Isaiah continues his upwards movement in describing
the new creation: first the soil (23a), then the beasts (23b— 24),
now up to the hills and on to the heavenly bodies. He does not
elaborate on the great slaughter and the fall of the towers, but
passages like 2:12; 13:1-12; 25:1-S show that his vision of the
Day of the Lord includes the overthrow of his foes and of their
systems of self-security. But the other side of the Day is
transformation (arid hill-tops flowing with water), hitherto
unexperienced light as creation is restored to its true powers
(seven times; 24:23; Rom. 8:21), and healing for those whom
both their own sinfulness and divine chastisements have
wounded.
Contemporary events: Assyria no threat (30:27-33). This
final section of the woe matches the first (1-7). The Lord’s
people turn from him to Egypt, but he does not turn from them
when Assyria threatens. This accords with the heart of the matter
(8-26), that though they spurn his word (8-17) he keeps his word
(18-26). What then will happen when Assyria attacks? Why, the
king of Assyria coming to Jerusalem is climbing on to his own
funeral pyre! Isaiah starts with the ‘real’ day of the Lord (27-28).
He is Lord over all the nations. (By implication, what is Assyria,
compared with such a God!) The Lord’s people will be safe in his
Day (29-30): their part will be to sing amid the judgments of
God (24:14-16). So then, regarding Assyria in the here and now
(31-33), they will be shattered (31), Judah will sing (32), the
funeral pyre is ready and so is the fire (33). Once more the
structure of the verses proclaims their message: the great
surrounding bracket is the Lord. In the Hebrew, the Name of the
Lor is the first line and the breath of the LORD is the last. The
199
ISAIAH 30:27—33
next bracket is his lordship over the nations as a whole (27-28)
and over Assyria in particular (30-33), and at the heart of the
poem is the singing people (29). Both on the large scale (27-28)
and in the actual events of history (30-33), the Lord’s people are
central to his concerns.
27. The Name of the LoRD means ‘the Lord in the fullness of
his revealed character’. From afar: Isaiah uses the storm motif
for the action of the Lord in wrath. He sees the storm rising in the
distance and gradually approaching (Ezk. 1:4). Smoke ... fire:
these were the exodus symbols of God’s presence (Ex. 13:21) in
holiness (Ex. 19:18). Lips ... tongue: the references to the organs
of speech show that the Lord acts in accordance with the word he
has spoken (Rev. 19:11—13, 15, 21).
28. Breath, ‘Spirit’, accords with the storm metaphor, but also
indicates the agency through whom the Lord acts. Sieve of
- destruction: literally ‘of falsehood’, a sieve designed to sieve out
and expose all that is false and at the same time to discriminate
(Am. 9:9). The judgment of God is exact (Gn. 18:25). Along with
the sieve to discriminate there is the bit to control and direct
(37:29). The sovereign Lord guides all to their just and appointed
destiny.
29-30. Theirs is the song (29), his the victory (30). Song, as
always, typifies entering joyfully into a benefit to which we have
made no contribution. The primary night festival was the
Passover, which suits this context with its exodus references to
cloud and fire (27, 30) and to the Lord as Rock (Ex. 17; see on
17:10). The song looks back to Exodus 15:1ff., 20-21. The
Psalms give abundant evidence of music and singing in the
festivals and religious life of Israel, even though we do not know
what form those celebrations took. But this is no formal religious
act; hearts are rejoicing. Voice: the Lord is acting according to his
word. Arm is the organ of personal strength in action and is an
exodus symbol (e.g. Ex. 6:6; Dt. 4:34; 5:15; 7:19). The strange
mixture of fire and hail is found in Exodus 9:23. The Lord does
not change: the exodus-Passover revelation is a declaration of his
Name for ever (Ex. 3:15). 5
31-33. As once in Egypt, so also in his own land (14:24-27) he will strike. The Lord is revealed in the past and alive in the present. Voice: see on verse 27. It only needs the Lord to speak to shatter the mightiest of earth’s powers. With his sceptre ... is better, “who, as (the/his) rod, was smiting’ (see 10:5). The Assyrian came on a divine mission of chastisement but also on an equally divine mission of self-destruction (10:12-15). Tam- bourines and (lit.) ‘battles of shaking/sieving’ reiterate the
200
ISAIAH 31:1
balance (29-30) between the song and the noise of conflict and
the discriminating judgments of God. Topheth: see 2 Kings
23:10; Jeremiah 7:31—32; 19:6, 11, 14. The name possibly arose
from taking the consonants of the word pat, ‘fire-place’, and
giving them the vowels of bdSet, ‘shame, disgrace’. The result
would be ‘the shameful burning place’. For a reason unknown,
Isaiah uses here another form of the name, topteh, but with the
same significance. How ironic that, all unknowingly, Assyria’s
imperial progress to Jerusalem (10:8-11) was a funeral
procession to a pyre long since prepared — and that by the Lord
himself, who would also ignite it when the time came! ‘So may
all your enemies perish, O LoRD’ (Jdg. 5:31).
v. The fifth woe: all things new (31:1 — 32:20). The second
woe was in two parts, for it covered both circumstantial and
spiritual problems in the Lord’s people. On the one hand there are
the often overwhelming odds which threaten us in this world
(29:1-8), and on the other the spiritual blindness which is part of
our fallen nature (29:9-14). Over all this the Lord is competent to
deliver (even at the eleventh hour) and transform. This matching
fifth woe first (31:1-9) sees Judah, Egypt and Assyria embroiled
at Jerusalem but observes a fourth ‘component’ enter the scene:
the Lord, who will not allow Egypt to help or Assyria to hurt and
who carries off Jerusalem as his personal prey (31:4—5; cf 29:4—
6). Isaiah then goes on to a transformation scene matching 29:9—
14, the coming King and his renewed people (32:1-20). In
slightly closer detail, we start with a ‘prologue’ (29:1-5), which
deals with coming disaster and deliverance. This is balanced by
an ‘epilogue’ (32:19-20), forecasting disaster and blessedness.
The two internal sections are respectively a call to return/repent
(31:6 — 32:8), looking forward to a coming king reigning over a
new society, and a call to hear (32:9-18), looking forward to the
outpouring of the Spirit and a new society.
Disaster and deliverance (31:1-5). Jerusalem’s leaders knew
that when, backed by Egypt’s promises, they raised the flag of
rebellion, they would incur Assyrian reprisals. On what basis did
they make their choice — or, to put the matter from Isaiah’s
perspective: what constitutes a wrong choice? First, they
abandoned faith (1); secondly, they overlooked revealed truth (2);
and thirdly, they ignored common sense (3). 1. They did not, of course, abandon faith per se. Everybody lives by faith. It is part of the human condition. Financiers trust
market forces, militarists trust bombs, scientists trust nature’s
regularities. Jerusalem’s leaders trusted Egypt. Go down is a
201
ISAIAH 31:2-5
participle. They were in the very act, and the prophet would stop
them because they went to Egypt (la) and did not seek ... the
LorbD (1f), relied on horses (1b) and did not look to the Holy One
(le), and their gust was in numbers (multitude) and strength
(1ed). Note how Isaiah reserves trust to form the centrepiece of
his analysis. Around this focal point the verse presents a stark
choice: the Lord, or ...? They faced the most critical of tests — the
Assyrians — but the real crisis was: ‘Where is your faith placed?’
2. They ignored the truth about the Lord. Life must be faced
theologically, that is to say, in the light of what we know about
God. Can bring ... does ... rise up are all perfect tenses in the
Hebrew. They represent what never varies. In every situation the
Lord is wise (2a); if disaster threatens, he, the one who ‘brings’ it
(10:5-15), is the real force to be reckoned with (2a); he never
contradicts, revises or reneges on what he has said (2b): in both
his threats and promises he is unchangeable; the world under his
tule is morally accountable, and the wicked and evildoers will
find him their opponent (2cd). In making a choice, has the Lord’s
wisdom been consulted? Is he revered as the sovereign disposer
and director? Is his word known and obeyed? Is sin being
forsaken and holiness cultivated?
3. When his people seek help other than from himself, the
Lord will not allow it. The helpers who step in as a substitute for
the Lord come under condemnation as much as those who sought
them (cf 2cd). So here helper and helped alike stumble and fall.
But there is something else: every other source of help possesses
only derived life; it does not have life in itself. Men is ’adam,
humankind, the creature which has life only because God inbreathed it (Gn. 2:7). God is ’él, the most transcendent of the God
words, God exalted in majesty and in all the attributes of the
Most High. The contrast between flesh and spirit is between that
which needs life and that which possesses life (cf Jn. 4:24). The
Lord stretches ... helps: he is sovereign, not just positionally (as
el), not just distinctively (as the One who possesses life in - himself), but actually and practically. A mere hand-movement suffices! A true choice brings life itself to our aid. 4-5. The ‘For’ with which verse 4 opens offers two similes in explanation of verse 3: as a lion (4) and like birds (5). The Lord is the unabashed lion who will not yield its prey to another. Ironically Egypt is represented as shepherds (Gn. 43:32; 46:34; Ex. 8:26)! To do battle on (saba’ ‘al) is the same as in 29:8, where it was correctly translated ‘to fight against’. So here, in the three-handed fight, with Assyria attacking, Judah defending and Egypt supposedly helping, the Lord comes with the Assyrian
202
ISAIAH 31:6-9
forces to exact his due chastisement (10:5-11). What Egyptian
shepherds could rescue his prey? But with an abruptness copying
29:5, the picture changes: Jerusalem’s leaders had despised the
Lord. Would they have said, ‘About as much use as a sparrow!’?
But the weakness of God is stronger than men (1 Cor. 1:25).
Gentle towards his erring people as a hovering bird, his is the
fourfold strength to shield, deliver, pass over and rescue. The
numeral four symbolizes ‘on every side’. The hovering God is sufficient.
The first summons: repentance (31:6—9). Isaiah urges three
reasons for repentance: rebellion (6); preparation for the Day of
the Lord (7); and the coming deliverance from Assyria (8-9).
6—7. Return: repentance starts in the mind but shows its reality
by changing the direction of the life (1:27). Revolted: see 1:5. It
is typically biblical to keep ultimate matters in view. The day
referred to here is the ultimate Day of the Lord (cf 2:20). Biblical
faith is always at the ready, not simply to surmount the next crisis
but to stand before God (Lk. 21:36). Since that day will expose
idols as the ‘no-gods’ they are (2:8) and as mere human
expedients (hands ... made), the time to reject them is now, not
then when it will be too late.
8-9. Historical threats as well as eschatological ones must be
faced with repentance. Not of man (is) ... not of mortals
(adam): the deliverance will not come about by any individual,
nor any human agency. Sword is the Lord’s sword, which has
destroyed them (37:36). Forced labour: following the débacle of
701 BC, the Assyrian Empire entered-its long terminal illness.
Stronghold is ‘Rock’, most likely a reference to the king of
Assyria in contrast to the Rock of Israel (30:29) and in contrast to
the righteous king who will reign (32:1). Fall (V‘abar) is ‘pass
away’. It is the same as the Passover verb in verse 5. The Lord
‘passes over’ in deliverance, the king ‘passes away’ off the stage
of history. At the sight ...: the Hebrew here is extremely
compressed. The NIV rendering means that when the Lord lifts
his banner there will be complete collapse of power to resist. It
might, however, be translated ‘and his princes will be shattered
far from the banner’, ie. having deserted the colours. Declares
(n°um): see 1:24. Fire ... furnace reflects the Ariel imagery of
29:1. Zion cannot escape the threat constituted by its unique
privileges. It lives where the fire of the holy God burns. But all
who attack the Lord’s people bring themselves within range of
that same holy fire too. Righteous King, new society (32:1-8). In 29:9-14 Isaiah
foresaw a coming wonder from the Lord in terms of new
203
ISAIAH 32:1-5
wisdom. Having called his people to repent not only in the light
of the coming Assyrian deliverance (31:8-9) but also (and as a
priority) in the light of the Day of the Lord (31:6-7), he now
explores the glories of that day and the wonderful works of the
Lord. In addition, it is typical of this major section of the book of
Isaiah to move from Assyrian darkness to the brightness of the
coming King (cf 8:20 — 9:2ff.; 10:33 — 11:1ff.). In this way the
light of hope shines behind the clouds of adversity and sustains
the Lord’s suffering people. Isaiah foresees a royal administration which secures true values (1) and affords proper protection (2).
The people of this king are also themselves transformed (3-4),
and false values come to an end (5-8). It is a vision of a true king
_ and anew society. 1. A king: the indefinite is the idiom of indefiniteness for the
sake of emphasis, as if to say ‘A king — you know who I mean!’ It
is the messianic king of chapters 9 and 11. In 9:7 righteousness
marks his throne, in 11:5 his character, and here, as in 11:4, his
administration, where sound moral principles (righteousness)
issue in sound moral practice (justice). The king himself
embodies righteousness; his executives (rulers) apply his
principles in correct decisions (justice, see 28:26).
2. The translation each is perfectly sound: true ideals of rule
animate every member of the administration. But it is more
telling to find here again the idiom of indefiniteness, ‘a man (that
unique, special man)’. In 9:6—7 we read of the king’s deity, in
11:1 ff. his full endowment with the divine Spirit in the context of
his human ancestry, and here his personal, true humanity. In four
illustrations the perfection of his rule is pictured: the contrasting
dangers of wind and water (storm is ‘inundation’; or ‘driving
rain’, 28:2) point to protection from every threat; the supply of
igi and shadow in burning heat point to provision for every need.
34. Four transformations mark the people (cf 29:11—12, 18),
in perception (eyes), reception (ears), grasp (mind) and communication (tongue) of truth. Closed: the verb here is most likely that used in 6:10 of judicially imposed blindness and in 29:9 of wilfully chosen blindness. All this is reversed. Accom- panying these transformations in abilities there is transformation of character: the rash, ‘hasty’, all too prone to act precipitately, learn to stop and think; the stammerer’s hesitancy will become fluent and clear. S. An imperfect society accords honour imperfectly. Isaiah foresees a true aristocracy of character. Fool is nabal, a person who is morally obtuse, lacking a sense of moral and spiritual
204
ISAIAH 32:6-10
obligation (2 Sa. 13:13; Jb. 2:10; Ps. 14:1). Scoundrel: kilay and
the related word kélay (7) are found only here. They may be
derived from Vndkal with the thought of deception, deviousness
in seeking self-advantage to the hurt of others (Gn. 37:18; Nu.
25:18; Ps. 105:25). The one is a fool by what he lacks — moral
sensitivity; the other a scoundrel by what he has — a drive for
self-advantage at all costs. The fool is amoral, the scoundrel unscrupulous.
6-8 are a separate and, in literary form, a very clever poem,
amplifying the themes of the fool (6) and the scoundrel (7), and
ending (8) with a crisp statement about true nobility. Fool: see
verse 5. Speaks: an imperfect tense expressing characteristic
behaviour. The emphasis here and in verse 7 rests on sins of
speech. Evil (’dwen) is rather ‘trouble, mischief’ (10:1; Gn.
35:18), often what troubles the Lord and attracts his displeasure
(31:2; Ps. 92:9). Here it is the thought-life and lifestyle of one
who sits loose to moral and spiritual obligation. The fool is
against the Lord (6cd) and uncaring about the needy (6ef). Error
(t6°a) is found only in Nehemiah 4:8 and means turning people
off course, distracting them, leaving them without sure direction.
Scoundrel: see verse 5. He is ‘on the make’, a mixture of spiv and
social climber. Evil schemes (zimma), apart from Job 17:11, has a
uniformly bad meaning. It occurs nineteen times of sexual misconduct (e.g. Lv. 18:17). It is planning for one’s own advantage
at whatever cost to others. This includes cynical manipulation of
the legal system (plea ... just). Noble: liberally outgoing to God
(Ex. 35:5, 22) and to others (Pr. 19:6). It can be used of ‘noble’
rank (13:2), but here it is nobility of character. In the envisaged
society it is this nobleness which brings stability and security
(stands).
The second summons: hearing (32:9-14). Isaiah addresses
the women, presumably because, as in 3:16 — 4:1, he found them
to be the embodiment of characteristics he felt obliged to condemn in the whole society of Jerusalem: complacency and false
security. These could nullify his first call (31:6) to repentance.
Therefore there is need for Jerusalem to face facts. There is going
to be a loss of harvests (10), and then further loss involving land,
houses, palaces and city (13-14). The call to repent (31:6) was
enforced by the thought of the blessings to come; this is balanced
by this second call to ‘face the facts’ of the disasters on their way.
9-10. Complacent (Sa’“ndn) has a good sense, ‘undisturbed’
(18), but here the circumstances of ease which it expresses are
assumed as a personal and perpetual right. Secure or ‘trusting’ is
another great word put to a reprehensible use: a bland assumption
205
ISAIAH 32:11-15
that nothing disturbing can happen. The lost harvest: behind this
is the Assyrian invasion and the inability to work the land
(37:30). é :
11-14. The call to the women is renewed’ and with greater
intensity, because an even greater threat is coming. In verse 10
the vintage was lost; now it is the vines, the land (12-13) and the
city (14). The unfettered life of the animals (14d) bespeaks the |
absence of people (5:17). This was foretold in 6:11—-13, implied
in 11:11 and predicted again in 30:8-17. Strip: the verb is not
used as a sign of mourning. It here describes captivity and en- slavement. (20:2-13), a fate indeed for the women of Jerusalem (3:16ff.)! Thorns ... briers: the former can grow anywhere, the
latter is a plant of the wasteland. Together (the Hebrew has no
and) they express the thought that what was formerly cultivated has now become one with the wasteland. Fortress is ‘palace/
large house’; maybe here the royal palace is meant. Citadel could
be the place-name Ophel (Ne. 3:26), a southern projection of the temple mount. Watchtower could refer to ‘the tower of the flock’
(Mi. 4:8), though the word bahan is found only here.
Outpoured Spirit, new society (32:15-18). But though
disasters are coming, they do not have the last word — as Isaiah
discovered in 29:1-14. The Lord has a way both of reversing
disaster at the last minute and of looking beyond the disaster to
what he, in his undeflected will, determines to do. The coming of
the King (32:1) and the consequent new society are amplified
here in a new way. There will be an effusion of new divine life
(15a), transforming the world (15bc), establishing true moral and
spiritual values (16) and a peaceful, secure society (17-18).
15. The Spirit: the Spirit of God was the divine power at work
in creation (Gn. 1:2; Ps. 33:6). He is the life-giver (40:7; 42:5; Ps.
104:30). He raises people to new heights of ability (Ex. 35:30—
31) and empowers for mighty deeds (Jdg. 14:6; 15:4; 1 Sa. 10:6).
He indwells the great line of messianic figures (Nu. 11:17; 27:18;
1 Sa. 16:3; Is. 11:2; 42:1; 61:1) and is the Agent in the regeneration which will mark the messianic future (Ezk. 36:27).
! The verbs in vv. 11-12 are difficult. Tremble is masculine but addressed to women; the following four imperatives (11) are unusual in form: possibly aramaized 2nd plurals feminine, or masculine singular in the emphatic form (GKC 48i). In v. 12, ‘beating the breasts’ is a masculine plural participle (GKC 48). Gender switches are not uncommon in Hebrew (23:1 offers a masculine singular imperative with a feminine plural noun). There may be nothing more here than Isaiah failing to maintain the fiction of addressing the women when his see apply to all. Emendation, if thought necessary, would be simple: see BHS, ad loc.
206
ISAIAH 32:16-20
Poured: the Spirit originates in God who ‘pours out’ his own life
for purposes of renewal (44:3; Ezk. 39:29; Joel 2:28). The first
result of this future outpouring is a transformed creation (15).
What now appears as desert will be changed into ‘garden land’
(fertile field), with all the beauty the ordering hand of God will
impart; what is now reckoned as ‘garden land’, ordered and
purposeful, will, by comparison with the true order and beauty of
that day, seem as haphazard as scrubland (fores?).
16-18. The second result is that the new environment will be
animated by true moral and spiritual principles (righteousness),
expressed in sound moral regulations and practices (justice; cf.
1:21, 27; 9:7; 11:4) over the whole area of the new creation,
desert and fertile field alike. Thirdly, there will be a human
society marked by peace, in its full realization as peace with God,
harmonious relationships and personal fulfilment; quietness, that
is, ‘rest’ and ‘restfulness’ (28:12, 16); and confidence, meaning
both ‘trust’ and ‘security’. And fourthly (18), there will be
security of tenure. Undisturbed (Sa’*ndn) and secure form an
inclusio with verse 9, but it is more than a literary device. In
verse 9 the words expressed the hollowness of mere human
wishful thinking and confidence. In the new creation, all that
lacked substance in life will be replaced by solid reality.
Epilogue: Blessedness beyond disaster (32:19-20). This
matches the prologue (31:1-5), with its poetic expression of
disaster and deliverance. We now look forward to what Isaiah
describes as the fall of forest and city (19) and, beyond it, the
peace and spaciousness of a new world (20). Both judgment and
glory lie ahead, and now (31:6; 32:9) is the time to decide.
19. Hail: the verb occurs only here, but the noun occurred at
28:2, 17. The ‘forces’ of nature depict the advent of God, as a
good example. Cf Psalm 18:7—16, where what 1 Samuel 16 — 2
Samuel 1 depicts as a patient, unspectacular work of God in
delivering David and bringing him to the throne is described in
dramatic storm metaphors. The falling forest (cf. 6:13; 10:33-34)
is the toppling of earth’s powers. The levelling of the city (cf
24:10; 25:1—5) is the termination of human organization of the
world without God. 20. But there is blessedness for those who repent and hear
God’s voice (31:6; 32:9). This pastoral scene recalls the
messianic picture of 30:23-26. Blessed (asré) has three shades of
meaning: under divine blessing (Ps. 32:1), enjoying fulfilment of
life (Ps. 112:1) and doing the right thing at the right time (Ps.
2:12; 137:8-9). All three meet in the messianic future: divine
favour, personal fulfilment and total rectitude. Sowing ... letting
207
ISAIAH 33:1
is the life of those who enjoy home and tenure in such a place.
Every ... free: there is no danger in this land. Crops can be sown
anywhere without fear of marauders (Jdg. 6:3-6), and animals
left to roam.
vi. The sixth woe: home at last (33:1 — 35:10). The balanced
presentation of the six woes continues into this final one. First,
the matching third woe (29:15-24) was wholly visionary and
eschatological, as is also this one. Historical events can be read
between the lines, but our eyes are held all the time by the
undated future. Amongst many similarities between these two
passages we may note the Lebanon theme (29:17; 33:9; 35:2), the
blind and deaf (29:18; 35:5), redemption (29:22; 35:9-10) and
spiritual transformation (29:24; 33:24; 35:8). The main thrust of
the third woe was the transformation of the world and of ‘Jacob’,
and both these lines are now further developed in typical Old Testament ways. Secondly, this sixth woe continues from the
fifth. In brief, the royal theme (32:1) is developed in chapter 33;
the allusion to disaster preceding the great dawn of light (32:19)
is the ‘text’ for chapter 34, and the blessings in environment and
life awaiting the Lord’s people (32:15-18) are beautifully expressed in chapter 35. As a simple outline of the contents of
these chapters we can consider 33:1—12 as a prologue, sketching
the salvation of Zion (1-6) and the judgment of the peoples (7—
12). Then there are two universal proclamations (33:13; 34:1),
the first dealing with Zion and its king (33:13-24), and the
second with the final.overthrow (34:1-17); lastly, there is an epilogue: the pilgrimage of the redeemed through a renewed
world to Zion (35:1—10).
Ultimate realities: salvation and wrath (33:1—12). In 30:27—
33 Isaiah used the Lord’s overthrow of Assyria as a preview of
ultimate divine worldwide action (30:28). In the present passage
Assyria is veiled behind the reference to destroyer and traitor (1),
and judgment reaches out to the peoples (3, 12). But there is the
same feeling of eleventh-hour rescue. The people of God struggle
through one day at a time (2); there is a sense of despair within a dying world (7-9) followed by the dramatic threefold now (10). aie The salvation of Zion. Salvation, eventually, will come to Zion.
__ 1. Destroyer ... traitor: the background is Assyria’s duplicity in seeming to accept Hezekiah’s ransom-money (2 Ki. 18:13-18) and then continuing to attack Jerusalem as if no agreement had ever been reached. As in 21:2; 24:16, Isaiah sees this two-faced approach to moral issues as characteristic of the ongoing world to
208
ISAIAH 33:2-6
the End. Not been destroyed: Assyria in its own day, and all
Assyria’s successors in worldly power, have ‘got away with it’.
Not been betrayed: it was not the treacherous action of others
which provoked a response of treachery; it was simply a matter
of lack of moral scruple. When you stop: i.e. when your career of
treachery has run its appointed course. Be betrayed: under divine
tule the world is a system of exact moral retribution. The punishment will be what the crime merits.
2. O LoRD: within a morally perverse world (1), the people of
God live by heavenly resources sought through prayer. Gracious:
see 30:18. Long, as in 30:18, should be ‘wait’ (Vqgawd) which
combines the patience of waiting with the confidence of hope. It
is the mark of the remnant (8:17; cf 40:31). Our strength: lit.
‘their arm’. The ‘arm’ is the organ of personal strength in action
(52:10). Probably here we have a snatch from a liturgy actually
used in Isaiah’s time, in which the leader prayed, ‘Be their arm
every morning’, and the assembly replied, ‘Be our salvation in
time of distress’. Instead of saying prosaically that every day
(morning), and in response to trouble (distress), the Lord’s people
resort to prayer, Isaiah slipped in a little cameo of prayer actually
happening (Acts 4:24ff.; 12:5).
3-4. The spotlight returns to the world. The praying people (2)
express their confidence that the whole world is helpless before
divine power (3ab) and will be utterly plundered (3cd). Flee ...
scatter are perfects of certainty: ‘sure to/doomed to’. Rise up: the
seated Lord awaits his appointed moment (Heb. 10:12—13), and
when it comes all he needs to do in the face of the massed powers
of the world is to stand up. The battle (plunder) is over before it
started (Rev. 19:19-20). Men pounce: the verb is a singular
participle without any subject expressed — ‘there is one
pouncing’. If it refers to human activity it is an enthusiastic
entering upon the victory the Lord has wrought, but it is more
likely to refer to divine action bringing the victory to a total
conclusion by taking the spoil (53:12).
5-6. Isaiah moves from the defeated world (3-4) to the
coming Zion. The Lord rose up to battle (3). How will Zion fare
when he is exalted? — for he does not change, he dwells on high,
and it is the same transcendent God, who demolished the power
(3) and stripped the spoil (4) of the nations, with whom they have
to do. First (5b), he will act to make Zion what he promised it
would be (1:26—27), just in practice, righteous in principle.
Secondly (6a), he will himself be Zion’s stability. In contrast to
all the times (‘ér) of distress they had known (2), they will enter
upon their true times.(‘éf) of security. Thirdly (6b), the Lord will
209
ISAIAH 33:7-12
be his people’s resource. Store (from Vhasan, ‘to be strong’) is
practical resource for life. Salvation is here a plural of amplitude,
hence NIV rich, a divine sufficiency for every emergent need.
Wisdom caters for the practical understanding and management
of life. Knowledge is knowledge of the truth as such, the result of
29:18. The fear ...: literally ‘the fear of the Lord, that is his
treasure’. To whom does ‘his’ refer? Zion is feminine and Judah
is not mentioned in the passage. It must, therefore, be the Lord.
In 29:23 one of the blessings predicted was ‘awe’ before the Lord. To fear him with a true fear is not a human emotion worked
up but a gift he gives to those whom he delights to bless. 7-12, World judgment. The moment for the Lord to rise up
(3) has come (10). !
7-9. The Assyrian crisis provides the backdrop to what is now
a vision of world collapse before the Lord rising to judge. Brave:
the military who gathered their forces to rebel against Assyria
came belatedly to realize they had no hope (37:3), and where
human strength failed, human wisdom was equally at a loss:
envoys were sent (2 Ki. 18:14), but lived to weep over the
duplicity which broke the treaty. But what thus happened in
connection with Assyria is no more than a reflection of the End.
Humankind’s effort by strength and wisdom to organize the
world without God will end in collapse, strength exhausted (7a),
wisdom baffled (7b), the busy world hushed (8ab), moral values
rubbished (8c). Witnesses (see NIV mg.) is ‘cities’. In pursuit of
world dominion Assyria left a trail of destruction. At the End, the
determination to create world order, a world city (24:10) on
human principles, will crash, and human life itself be discounted
(8d). Finally (9) what started with the thorns of Genesis 3:18 will
end with the withering of all nature. Lebanon typifies the
permanent, what has always been; Sharon, the beautiful; Bashan,
the fertile; and Carmel, the ‘garden land’, planned and ordered.
Withers occurs only here and in a similar context in 19:6. It may
mean ‘to be infested (with lice)’ — but here a pest so virulent that
even Lebanon falls to it. This is what human sin does initially,
progressively and permanently to the environment.
10-12. Arise: the Lord’s arising (cf 3) has two simultaneous
consequences, the self-destructiveness of sin (11) and divine judgmental action in fire (12). Conceive ... give birth: past decisions have inevitable outcomes; acts produce results (Gal. 6:7). Life without God is chaff producing straw, and the destructive agent is part of the same mechanism: your breath. Sinners are both the ultimate (conceive) and immediate (fire) cause of their own ruin. But the passive be burned ... set ablaze
210
ISAIAH 33:13-16
points to another agent. 7o lime stresses the intensity of the blaze.
As if should be omitted and ‘in fire’ added. ‘Fire’ is the holiness
of God in its active hostility to sin and sinner. The tragedy of sin
is that it turns life to straw; its danger is that it excites the wrath of God.
The first universal proclamation: the new Zion (33:13—24).
Isaiah now brings us within the expected Zion. He has already
dealt with the city in broad principle (5-6); now he describes its
people and its king. The central verse of this section is 20, the
city of peace; this is flanked by the presence of the King (17-19,
yes and the picture is completed by Zion’s people (14-16,
13, The summons. The opposites far and near express totality.
In its worship Israel was often conscious of a worldwide
dimension (Pss. 47:1; 96:3, 10; 98:4). This implied that what the
Lord revealed of himself and what he had done, savingly, for his
people, were also for the world (cf 2:2-4). The world must hear
what I have done (Acts 2:11). Power (g°burd) is warrior power,
power of accomplishment. But hear and acknowledge (lit.
‘know’) show that the world is not going to be won by a display
of overwhelming force but by the persuasion of the truth.
14-16, Zion’s people (part 1). First (14), the people are
gripped by the seriousness of sin and the impossibility of sinners
dwelling with the holy God. Sinners (hatta’im): see 1:28; 30:1.
Sin is a falling short (Rom. 3:23). Godless means ‘profane’ (9:17;
10:6; 24:5; 32:6). It implies defaming the divine nature and
dismissing God as negligible. Burning is translated ‘altar hearth’
in Leviticus 6:9 and therefore has the same significance as Ariel
(29:1). There is always fire burning on the Lord’s altar to
proclaim the presence of the Holy One. This fire is a threat
(consuming) and a changeless reality (everlasting). Dwell is the
verb for temporary residence, as of a person who has no natural
right to be there. There are, however, entrance qualifications (15). This verse is
what is called an ‘entrance liturgy’ (like Pss. 15; 24:3-6), ie. a
formal examination of someone desiring to enter the Lord’s
courts, in order to establish his right to do so. The sequence in
Isaiah’s poem is thoroughly biblical: before people can hear the
word of forgiveness (24) they must face the rigour of God’s law,
for only those who meet the law’s demands can enter the new
Zion. The verbs throughout are singular: the demand is individual
and, first, comprehensive: walks covers a person’s whole outward
lifestyle, characteristic behaviour; righteously (lit. ‘in righteousnesses’) is a plural of amplitude, righteousness in all its aspects
211
ISAIAH 33:17-20
and in all life. Secondly, there is straightforward truth in speech:
right means ‘straight’. Thirdly comes finance, with particular reference to how money is gained: extortion, refusal to subordinate
people to profit; bribes, refusal to subordinate truth to profit.
Fourthly, there is the mind: the ears receive what others say, the
eyes look where the observer directs. They are both channels into
the thought-life. Plots of murder is literally ‘hearing of bloodguilt’, which is listening either to what will bring guilt before
God on the hearer, or to that which tells of guilt incurred by others. For the one who is thus righteous immense privileges
open up (16): fellowship with the Lord, i.e. dwell on the heights
(of Zion); security: refuge is ‘top security’, to be set on an
inaccessible height; and provision (bread and water). 17-19, Zion’s King (part 1). Isaiah shows the King in his
personal attractiveness (17a), his wide domain (17b) and the
absence of the once dominant enemy (18) and of all evidence of
foreign occupation (19). Your eyes will see: i.e. you will see for
yourself. Alongside the exclusion of sinners (14) and the
impossible demands of the law (15), how can there be any in the
presence of the King to see his personal excellence (beauty; Ps.
45:2)? This is a question awaiting an answer. The king lacks the
definite article in the Hebrew and, as in 32:1, exemplifies indefiniteness for the sake of emphasis. As the presence of the
King is enjoyed, so also is the absence of former foes. The
description of the officials is vague. Chief officer is ‘one writing’,
took the revenue is ‘one weighing’, and in charge is again ‘one
writing’. Perhaps the first listed prisoners for deportation, the
second registered the spoil, and the third made an inventory of buildings for demolition. But now they and their troops and all
their unintelligible talk are in the past (no more). There is nothing
to distract from the presence and contemplation of ‘a king — you know who I mean!’
20, The city of peace. This is the beating heart of the poem.
Look (Vhdzd) is the same verb as see in verse 17. In itself it is
simply a verb of ‘seeing’ but here used of a fixed examination of
the city, such as the beauty of the King himself would command. Our festivals: Zion is first a city of religious privilege and joyous fellowship with the Lord. The main festivals of the past were recollections of the exodus and of redemption (Dt. 16:1-17, note esp. 3, 12; Lv. 23:42-43). Thus the Zion to come is a redemption- centred city. Peaceful: ‘untroubled’ (32:9, 18). Not be moved ... pulled up ... broken: from its redemption centre Isaiah moves to the security of Zion: unthreatened from outside, with no need ever to move, and unthreatened by any weakness in itself (ropes,
212
ISAIAH 33:21-24
stakes). Tent looks back to the wilderness days, so often thought
of as an ideal of walking with God (Je. 2:1—3), but here the tent
pegs are never moved again, so pilgrimage is over and the travellers are home at last.
21-23, Zion’s King (part 2). Two thoughts alternate: the Lord
in power (21a); much water, no shipping (21bcd); the Lord as
king (22); helpless shipping, abundance of spoil (23). In the
parallel verses (17-18) Isaiah introduced the King and his wide
lands; here is the King and his wide seas. He is thus in principle
the King of all. He is also the Lord, the divine King (9:6). Mighty
Caddir; Ps. 93:3) signifies absolute or dominant power. Our
means ‘belonging to us’ or ‘on our side’. Streams are ‘Nilecanals’, suggesting, as in Egypt, an endless water supply. Galley
... mighty ship: the passage might require that these are men-ofwar, and that for all the abundance of water there is no sea-borne
attack. But the wording is not explicit. Mighty is ’addir, as above,
but it could intend ‘able to dominate the seas’. In this case the
thought is absence of commercial enterprise, pointing to the selfsufficiency of Zion. This suits the explanation offered in verse
22: we have the Lord; what more do we need! He is judge,
sufficient in leadership, victory and government as were the
judges of old; /awgiver, sufficient in day-to-day guidance; but,
unlike the episodic judges of old, he is king, permanent in office
and able to save. This last function is now explained in a telling
picture of a crippled ship which nevertheless carries off an
abundance of spoil (23). As a ‘ship of state’, Zion is helpless, yet
this limping hulk takes the spoil! Spoils ... plunder: the battle is
over and the victory has been won — surely by the Saviour King!
24, Zion’s people (part 2). In verses 13-16 Zion’s people
faced the impossible and helpless condition of sinners before the
holy God and the demands of his law; yet in verse 17 there were
those enjoying the personal sight of the king. This second view of
Zion’s people is an explanation without an explanation: the
people in Zion are forgiven sinners, but we are not told here how
their forgiveness came about or how the demands of the law were
satisfied in their case. Yet where the former passage was ‘the
law’s loud thunder’, that thunder has now been hushed and the
gospel takes over. In Zion there is neither sickness (i//) nor sin
(forgiven). We can understand this as physical well-being along
with spiritual well-being; or we can understand il] as figurative
(like the lameness of 23; cf 53:4; Ps. 107:17—20), i.e. the malady
of sin is gone as is also its guilt. Forgiven (nasa’): ‘to lift up,
bear, carry’. This usage derives from the sin-bearing ‘scapegoat’
(Lv. 16:21) on which were placed all Israel’s iniquities, so that it
213
ISAIAH 34: 1-3
might carry them off, never to be seen again. So here Isaiah
simply says ‘and as regards the people living in it, iniquity will
be carried off’ . Iniquity (‘Gw6n): see 1:4; 6:7.
The second universal proclamation: final judgment (34:1—
17). This theme is exactly what one would expect at this point in
the sixth woe. The prologue (33:1—12) introduced the topics of
salvation (1-6) and judgment (7-12). The former was elaborated
in the first universal proclamation (33:13-24); the latter is
developed now. 1-10b, The judgment is the Lord’s. Following the call to
nations and peoples to listen (1), Isaiah announces the Lord’s
anger against earth and heaven (2-4), the Lord’s sword falling on
Edom (5—6d), the Lord’s sacrifice in Edom (6e—7), and the Lord’s
vengeance on behalf of Zion (8-10b). In the Hebrew each of
these divisions opens with ‘For’ and each announces its topic in
matching words: the Lord ‘has indignation’ (2), ‘has a sword’ (6),
‘has a sacrifice’ (6e), ‘has a day’ (8). 1. Typically of the Bible, the summons to hear of coming
judgment is not the Lord’s first word to the world. The first
summons was to hear of sin (33:14), the standard of the law of
God (33:15) and the message of forgiveness (33:24). The world
must hear what the Lord has done for Zion because the same
salvation reaches out to the ends of the earth (Ps. 96 — 98). But
should the ‘gospel call’ remain unheeded, the sanction of divine
judgment remains and the world must hear that too.
In verses 2-4, judgment proceeds from the nature of God
(angry). If the Lord were not a holy God, and if his holiness were
not a positive force against sin and sinners, there would be no
need for salvation (Rom. 1:16—18). Earth (2-3) and heaven (4)
alike are caught up in this final judgment: nations (2), individuals
(3ab), the environment (3c), the cosmos (4).
2. Reintroduce the initial ‘For’. This is the first explanation of
the summons to the world. Angry (qesep): for the noun, cf 54:8;
60:10; for the verb, 8:21; 47:6; 54:9; 57:16-17; etc. This is the
sharp outbursting of anger. Wrath (hémé), ‘heat’, is its abiding
animosity. Totally destroy is Vharam, which provides the noun
‘harem’, the place of segregation. In judgmental contexts this is
the removal from further human contact of that which is so
appalling that it must at once be consigned to God for his decision. The noun herem occurs in verse 5 (cf. 11:15; Nu. 21:2; Jos. 2:10; 6:17-18). Finally, slaughter is the death due to sin and sinners.
3. Their dead bodies: God does certainly hate the sin and love the sinner, but if the sinners refuse the ‘gospel call’ they suffer
214
ISAIAH 34:4-6d
the penalty of their sin and the distinction between sin and sinner
breaks down. Soaked: literally ‘melted’ by a new and dreadful
soil erosion through the torrential blood of the slain.
4. Here only the ‘fabric’ of the heavens (not the heavenly
‘host’, 24:21; 27:1) is mentioned. The whole cosmos has been infected with human sin. Dissolved: ‘decayed’, ‘rotted’, an internal
corruption working destruction. Rolled up: the Lord determines
when the story is finished and closes the book. The internal
rotting is matched by the external decision to write ‘Finished’.
Fall (‘fade’) ... withered ... shrivelled: the inner forces of life are
gone; also harvest-time has come and the harvest has been reaped.
5—6d. Edom is presented as a case in point. Even though Esau
himself had no capacity for sustained animosity (Gn. 33:4—16), it
was with him that relations with Jacob were soured (Gn. 27:41)
and by the time of Numbers 20:14~-21 hostility had become an
established pattern. Saul made war on Edom (2 Sa. 14:47). David
became the only king to subdue and annex Edom (2 Sa. 8:14; cf:
1 Ki. 11:15—16). Edom rebelled against Solomon (1 Ki. 11:1-17,
23-25) and was still rebelling a century later (2 Ki. 8:20). Fifty
years further on, there was still fighting (2 Ki. 14:7, 10), and at
the fall of Jerusalem the bitter hostility of Edom became notorious (Ps. 137:7; Ob. 10-14). Consequently Amos’ accusation
(1:11) of perpetual hatred is well founded. Jeremiah 49:7—22
shows that, even prior to Edom’s behaviour at Jerusalem’s fall,
the idea of judgment on Edom was part of the prophetic
worldview. Obadiah saw Edom as both a place and a symbol:
meriting judgment in its own right but also picturing the
judgment which would mark the Day of the Lord. He was not
innovating: in Psalms 60:8; 83:6, Edom had already a symbolic
place in the theme of hostility to Zion. Two factors make Edom
specially fit to stand as a motif for the whole world in the final
judgment: first, its ceaseless hostility to the Lord’s people, and
secondly the fact that it was only to David that it ever really
succumbed. Thus Ezekiel, foreseeing the coming David (34:23),
moves immediately to the conquest of Edom (35:1—15). Isaiah
stands in this same tradition by following his forecast of the King
(ch. 33) with the rout of Edom in the final judgment (cf 11:14;
63:1-6). Recollecting 29:22 and the establishing of the family of
Jacob, the overthrow of Edom/Esau makes the End the exact
fulfilment of the beginning (Gn. 25:23). The purposes of God
according to election stand. Totally destroyed: literally ‘the
people of my herem’ (see 2). Fat ... blood were the parts of the
slaughtered beast that belonged only to God (Lv. 3:16-17; 7:23—
Zk5
ISAIAH 34:6e-15
27). In judgment the Lord seeks what is peculiarly his, that to
which he alone has a right. Ps
6e-7. The hint of a sacrificial rite in 6a-c is now explicitly
developed. Bozrah, twenty-seven miles south of the Dead Sea,
was Edom’s capital. Sacrifice was the appointed way in which the
demands of the divine holiness had to be met. Wild oxen were not
used in the sacrifices. Possibly therefore Isaiah is using animal
metaphors for the important people and leaders of Edom.
8. Vengeance: the sacrifice required by divine holiness (6e—-7)
is also the exact requital human sin merits. Zions cause adds a third divine motive to sacrifice and vengeance. Zion has a just
cause against Edom, and it can be left to him to whom vengeance
belongs. ; 9-10b round off this whole picture of judgment by noting,
first, the blighted environment, substantiating the Bible’s view
that the greatest environmental threat is human sin, and,
secondly, the perpetual result, night and day ... forever. This
thought forms a bridge into the second half of the section.
10c-17, The judgment is in perpetuity. Isaiah continues his
development of God’s judgment of the world.
10c—15. The opening words from generation to generation not
only form a link with the preceding half of the poem (1—10b) but
announce the theme of this second half. That this great judgment
of God is for perpetuity is shown by the disappearance of
humankind (10d—13) and the incoming of the beasts (14-15). The
ordinary events of life (10d, pass through), and the special duties
of life (12, nobles, princes) are things of the past, and in their
place come wild creatures (1lab, 13cd) and weeds (13ab). All
this happens by divine action (God will stretch). The measuring
line is a picture of dividing up a land for new ownership, and the
plumb-line depicts how what happens accords with what ought to
be. Chaos ... desolation are respectively tohi and bdhii, the
‘formless and empty’ of Genesis 1:2; see 24:10. Before the
ordering hand of God imposed beauty, purposefulness and design
upon it, the created physical substrate of the world was
meaningless, dark, uninhabitable, shapeless, empty (cf Je. 4:23). It is this to which sin brings everything at the End. The End is a world without people or purpose, shape or meaning. The Lord imposes on a world of sinners that which they chose and achieved. The permanency affirmed in verse 10 is depicted in 14— 15. The verses are bracketed by references to the animals and their mates, and the intermediate lines speak of rest and raising broods. It is all a cosy scene of settled and undisturbed domestic security. Wild goats may hint at the supposed ‘goat-demon’
216
ISAIAH 34:16 — 35:2
(13:21), and night creatures suggest /ilit, the ‘night hag’, but it is
more probable that Isaiah gives the beasts emotive names to increase the sense of frightful change.
_ 16-17. These verses are a final summons, with plural
imperatives matching verse | and rounding off the presentation.
We read of horrific coming judgment and, with our blurred
understanding of holiness and diminished capacity for moral
outrage, we incline to say, ‘Surely not!’ Just as much as Isaiah’s
hearers, we need this word of stern reminder that it will indeed be
so. Mate recalls the same word in verse 15. By measure mirrors
the metaphor of verse 11. It will be as stated! The sequence
mouth ... Spirit ... hand guarantees that the event will correspond
to the Lord’s word, be implemented by his power, and come
about through his direct personal touch. Jn the scroll: there is no
other passage of Scripture to which appeal may be made. Are we,
however, right to understand Isaiah to mean ‘and read that ...’,
i.e. there are passages in Scripture supportive of what is asserted?
Maybe we should translate the connective ki (overlooked in NIV)
as ‘and read, because ...’ In this case, Isaiah is calling us to a
searching acquaintance with God’s written word, on the grounds
that every smallest detail — down to the birds and beasts — comes
from his mouth, will be implemented by his Spirit and applied by his hand.
Ultimate realities: pilgrims to Zion (35:1-10). In the
matching third woe there was an understated reference to
redemption (29:22). It is now the climax to the whole series,
expressed in one of the most beautiful poems ever written. It is an
exodus-based poem. Pilgrims through a desert land (1-2) find
that their bleak environment changes for them — and exults to do
so (2b)! The pilgrims themselves, however (3-4), are under
oppression, just as the exodus people were, but they are
summoned to fortitude in full confidence of divine salvation. In
verses 5—7, they are once again in the desert but, this time, not
only is it being transformed for their benefit (6c—7) but there is
another transformation also: the pilgrims are renewed for their
journey (5—6ab). Their salvation has been accomplished. Now a
clear highway lies before them (8a), a raised causeway. It is only
for the holy (8bc); it is unmistakably clear (8e) and free of danger
(9). Thus, at length, the Lord’s redeemed arrive with joy in Zion
(10). 1-2, New world, a promise to the pilgrims. The exodus
background to these verses is plain. When Israel set out from
Egypt, the most unpromising places supported them (Ex. 15 — 17)
and it was in the wilderness that they saw the glory of the Lord

ISAIAH 35:3—-4
(Ex. 16:10). To be glad we must add ‘for/of them’ as the Hebrew
does.' These unnamed people reappear in verse 2¢ as they, in 8d
as those (lit. ‘them’) and, finally, in 10b they are identified as the
redeemed who come to Zion. Either their presence brings new
life to the world (‘glad of them’), or the world hastens to put on
new beauty ‘for them’. The former accords with Romans 8:19-
21; the latter implies the removal of the curse and the restoration
of that free bounty with which the Garden greeted the man and woman before the fall. Doubtless, in Exodus 17, the water
which flowed for the Lord’s people made the desert blossom momentarily, but Isaiah foresees the final pilgrims making their
way through a glorified environment, in which ‘Heaven above
is softer blue,/Earth around is sweeter green;/Something lives
in every hue;/Christless eyes have never seen.” Lebanon represents the work of God, and not of man (Ps. 104:16); Carmel
actually means ‘garden-land’, ordered cultivation; and Sharon
(Song 2:1) provides a standard of beauty. All this transforms the former desert ... wilderness, but those who walk through it see
more than the beauty of creation: they see the glory and splendour of the Creator. Nothing now hinders the full display of
the glory of the Lord in the works of the Lord. His glory is his inherent worth; his splendour is his majesty and dignity seen
outwardly.
3-7, New life, salvation for the pilgrims. The exodus pilgrims, looking ahead, did not see the blossoming, only the
barrenness (Ex. 15:21). The blossoming came as they walked the
pilgrim path.
3-4. It is for this reason that Isaiah now calls his pilgrims to
strengthen their hands. Hands means strength for personal action
(as we speak of ‘putting our hands to the task’); knees suggests
stability and persistence, the durability to stick with the
pilgrimage; hearts need nourishing in those convictions that keep
us going with mental, emotional and spiritual commitment. In
this last matter especially we must minister encouragement to
each other (say ... ‘Be strong, do not fear ...’; cf. Heb. 10:24~25). But the great ground of encouragement is your God. Again, we may think of the darkest days in Egypt when one and another would recall the promise of God to Jacob, ‘I myself will go down
! The verb ‘will be glad’ includes the suffix of the 3rd person plural masculine pronoun. Hebrew does, however, exemplify direct objects with transitive verbs (GKC 117x, e.g. 27:4; 35:9; Zc. 7:5), therefore ‘be glad over them’ is linguis- tically accurate. Theologically it links, as in Rom. 8:22, the liberation of creation with the revelation of the children of God. ? From G. W. Robinson, ‘Loved with everlasting love’.
218
ISAIAH 35:5—9c
to Egypt with you, and I myself will surely bring you up again’
(Gn. 46:4, lit.), or the words of Joseph, ‘God will surely visit you
and bring you up out of this land’ (Gn. 50:24, lit.). Vengeance
(naqam, 34:8) takes account of the wrong suffered by his people;
retribution (g‘mil) repays the wrong done to his people.
Vengeance and retribution are what he will do to his adversaries; but for his people he will work salvation.
5-7. Verses 5 and 6 both begin with an emphatic Then. They
refer to the work of divine salvation (4f). God’s work of salvation
will make his people new (5—6ab). The weaknesses of the present
(3—4ab) will be transformed into new abilities. The contrast
between two faculties of reception (eyes, ears) and two of action
(leap, shout for joy) is meant to express totality. On eyes and
ears, see 29:11-12, 18; 30:20-21; 32:3. Water is preceded by
‘For’. The renewal of life in nature explains as well as illustrates
what has happened to the saved. Only God can bring about such
transformation (water ... in the wilderness), such reversals
(burning and thirsty ... pool and springs; i.e. places that absorbed
moisture now retain and provide it), and such restorations
(jackals — the inhabitants of inhospitable areas — go and their
former haunts become grass, reeds and papyrus): this is the
opposite of the incoming beasts as the sign that human habitation
is over (34:14~-15).
8-10, New highway, homecoming for pilgrims. 8—9c. Highway is exactly what it says: a causeway raised above the
surrounding countryside so that it is unmistakable. The Way of
Holiness: this is obviously a seriously-meant requirement, for the
unclean cannot travel it. This is the equivalent of the ‘law of
God’ passage in 33:14-16. The Lord never reduces his standards
to match the weaknesses of his people; he raises his people to the
height of his standards. How this will happen Isaiah does not say;
he simply leaves us to assume that such meeting of the
requirements of the law is achieved for the Lord’s people by his
work of salvation (4f) and redemption (9d, 10a), for the redeemed
will walk there! Unclean (tamé’) refers to impurities catered for
by the sacrifices. Those disqualified from walking the Way of
Holiness are therefore self-disqualified through failure to use the
means of grace available to them. Those is ‘them’, see on verse 1.
Fools (’ °wilim) are the ‘gormless’, those who will inevitably get
it wrong even if not given half a chance, those who lack steady,
guiding principles. The intention here is to emphasize that
certainty of arriving at the destination is not dependent on human
ability or ‘nous’. The assurance of final salvation is inherent
in the initial work of salvation (4f) with its consequence of
219
ISAIAH 35:9d-10
radically overcoming human frailties (S6ab). This thought is
continued in the reference (no lion) to the absence of any external
threat such as would stop the pilgrim from reaching the end of
the road. 9d—10. Redeemed ... ransomed: the verb ‘to redeem’ makes its
first appearance in Isaiah here. \ga’al stresses the person of the
redeemer, his relationship to the redeemed, and his intervention
on their behalf. The participle, go’él, is the technical term for the
next-of-kin who has the right to take his helpless relative’s needs
as if they were his own (Lv. 25:25; Nu. 5:8); go’él is often translated ‘avenger’, the one whose right it is to pursue the murderer of his next-of-kin. This dramatically indicates the
essentially substitutionary nature of the relationship — the one being dead, the other acting in his place (Nu. 35:12; Dt. 19:6).
The place of the go’él was something no other dare usurp (Ru.
3:12; 4:1-6). It was, however, a right rather than an inalienable
duty. It speaks here, therefore, of the Lord as the only one who
can redeem his people; it is his inalienable right; it is he who
identifies with them as their Next-of-Kin, taking their needs as if
his own, the Mighty in the place of the helpless, paying their
price (Lv. 27:13, 19, 31). On pada (‘to ransom’), see 1:27. They
will enter: travelling (8-9) gives way to arriving (10b). Gladness
... Will overtake them (10c) or ‘they will overtake gladness ...’,
as if all their lives they were reaching after a true happiness
which they never quite reached. Either way, at last the people of the Lord and the joy of the Lord are united. Sorrow and sighing
are the negative counterparts of gladness and joy. Their exit leaves joy in sole possession of the city and its happy band of pilgrims.
b. Epilogue: the rock of history (36:1 — 37:38)
These chapters are a historical narrative matching 2 Kings 18 —
19.’ Isaiah cuts into the story at 2 Kings 18:13—-16. The Assyrian
1 Cf 35:9; 41:14; 43:1, 14; 44:6, 22-24; 47:4; 48:17, 20; 49:7, 26; 51:10; 52:3, 9; 54:5, 8; 59:20; 60:16; 62:12; 63:4, 9, 16.
? Did Isaiah take this passage from an original in 2 Ki. 18:13 — 20:21 (as the
majority of specialists seem to hold), or did the Kings historian take it from Isaiah
(Oswalt, The Book of Isaiah 1 — 39; Young, Studies in Isaiah), or did both adapt it
for their purposes from an original (J. Wilderberger, Jesaja, Neukirchner Verlag, 1982)? (a) If the Kings historian composed it, why is it unique in his book? Apart from 2 Ki. 14:25 it would be the only reference to a writing prophet by name and the only extended quotation of a prophetic oracle. Such an innovation would require explanation. It is most comparable to the Elijah-Elisha cycle, and most would agree that Kings derived this from an independent source. (b) If the material is original to Kings, why are the two incidents (36 — 37, 38 — 39) out of
220
ISAIAH 36:1 — 37:38
king had apparently accepted Hezekiah’s submission and a monetary satisfaction, but immediately renewed his pressure on Jerusalem. This is the ‘treachery’ referred to in 21:2; 24:16; 33:1. In Isaiah’s narrative the scene is thus set for a straight clash between two kings: the ‘great’ king of the earth (36:4) and the
beleaguered Davidic King in the city of promise (28:16). There is
important background in Isaiah which makes this single incident
of crucial significance. (a) In 14:24-27, the first ‘interim
fulfilment’ within chapters 13 — 27, Isaiah alerted his hearers to
watch out for the crushing of ‘the Assyrian in my land’ (14:25).
This is what the Lord has ‘planned’ and ‘it will stand’ (14:24),
but it is also part of the Lord’s purpose for ‘the whole world’
(14:26), that is to say, a case in point of his universal sovereign
sway. The emphases ‘it will stand’ (14:24) and ‘who can thwart
him?’ (14:27) make this a point at which (if we may say so) the
Lord cannot afford to fail. (b) The purpose of the cosmic
panorama of chapters 13 — 27 was to display the dimensions of
the kingdom of the coming King of David’s line (9:6, 7; 11:1-
16). Isaiah used the world map of his day and — as in 19:24-25
and 27:13 — made Egypt and Assyria symbols of the Lord’s
determination and power to make all nations his empire. (c) The
series of six ‘woes’ in chapters 28 — 35 were historically
concentrated on a situation in the last years of the eighth century
BC, in which these very nations, the Davidic kingdom, Egypt and
Assyria, were embroiled with one another. Now is the time, if
ever, for the Lord to demonstrate his mastery of history! In this
way, the present chapters put the rock of history under the fabric
of eschatology.
chronological order? There would be no justification for this in the Kings
narrative. (c) The two accounts are far from identical and, in their differences,
there is no consistency of practice. The major Isaianic addition (Hezekiah’s
prayer) is consistent with the claim (2 Ch. 32:32) that Isaiah wrote an account of
Hezekiah’s reign. (d) It is best to think of Isaiah and Kings as both having access
to court records. This would explain, for example, why Kings (18:14—16) includes
and Isaiah omits Hezekiah’s submission — the former aiming at completeness of
detail, the latter at history wedded to a theological purpose. Or again, the abbreviated account of Hezekiah’s illness and the addition of Is. 38:9-20 reflects
the prophet’s unwillingness to call attention to himself when his purpose is to stir faith in the Lord, and also reflects his privileged access to Hezekiah’s private
papers. (e) Only Isaiah would have .an interest in, and a justification for, the
reversed chronology, using the Sennacherib narrative as the crown to chs. 12 — 39 and the Merodach-Baladan fiasco as the perfect introduction to chs. 40ff. Though
for the most part the evidence of Kings and Isaiah suggests independent access to
existing records, the reversed chronology indicates that the Isaiah account was
well established by the time of the Kings historian.
221
ISAIAH 36: 1-3
i. The first Assyrian embassy: the helpless king (36:1 —
37:7). Sennacherib acceded as Assyrian king in 705 BC and was
greeted by uprisings throughout his conglomerate empire. The
most serious was that of Merodach-Baladan in Babylon, and it
took two years to quell his revolt. Then the king turned on his
western rebels, among whom was Hezekiah (2 Ki. 18:7; cf. Is.
38:1). According to Sennacherib forty-six Judean cities fell and
their people were deported. In the light of this collapse of his
armed rebellion, Hezekiah sought terms (2 Ki. 18:13—16). Isaiah
does not bother to record all this: he wants to bring us straight to
the point where he can demonstrate the effectiveness of faith, not
the results of faithlessness.
The first Assyrian speech: no salvation in faith (36:1—10).
1. Since Sennacherib’s attack took place in 701 BC, the fourteenth
year would date Hezekiah’s accession in 715. This conflicts with
2 Kings 18:1, 9, which dates his accession in 729/8. Some would
therefore make a slight emendation in the Hebrew text here to
read ‘twenty-fourth’. But both 2 Kings 18:13 and Isaiah 36:1
seem quite clear that the fourteenth year was the date of
Sennacherib’s arrival in Judah. Others appeal to a theory of coregency. Davidic kingship did not operate on the principle of
primogeniture. David, for example, was expected to nominate his
successor (1 Ki. 1:5-30). Supposing therefore that Ahaz,
Hezekiah and Manasseh all had periods of co-regency with their
predecessors as well as periods of sole reign, then perhaps
Hezekiah was co-regent with his father in 729-715 and sole king
in 715-696, when he took Manasseh into a co-regency lasting till
687. With a modicum of speculation this would harmonize the dates as we have received them.!
2-3. Field commander is the Rab-shakeh, an Assyrian title,
possibly originally ‘chief cup-bearer’ but by this time some high
officer of state. Lachish: thirty miles south-west of Jerusalem. A
pit has been unearthed with remains of about fifteen hundred casualties of Sennacherib’s attack. By this time Sennacherib had defeated the Tyrian and Philistine rebels, and the Egyptian army (on its one intervention) at El Tekeh, north of Lachish. Hezekiah was now isolated. Politically there was no reason why Senna- cherib should return home without dealing with the last rebel _ state. To this extent his cynical acceptance of Hezekiah’s gold was typical of the amoral element in politics: it lessened Heze- kiah’s capacity to buy allies and therefore further exposed him to
1 See H. H. Rowley, Men of God (Nelson, 1963), pp. 98ff.; K. A. Kitchen and T. C. Mitchell, ‘Old Testament Chronology’, in NBD. ss
222
ISAIAH 36:4-10
Assyrian might. The aqueduct where the various officials met the
Rab-shakeh was the very place (7:3) where Ahaz had refused the
way of faith; Hezekiah is about to reap the harvest of unbelief.
In verses 4-10 the Rab-shakeh’s speech has four themes:
Egypt is no hope (4~7); trusting the Lord is no longer an option,
for he has been alienated (7; 2 Ki. 18:4); Hezekiah has no man
power (8-9); and Assyria is backed by divine authorization (10).
4-5. The great king was a title the Assyrian kings commonly
used. This confidence refers to Hezekiah’s boldness in raising a
rebellion. You say follows the reading in Q* and 2 Kings 18:20.
The Isaiah text has ‘I say’, namely the Rab-shakeh’s own opinion
that Hezekiah’s rebellion is based neither on wise planning
(strategy) nor on military capacity (g“bird, see 30:15). Isaiah had
said (28:9-11) that if they refused his plain message they would
hear the same words from foreigners. Here are his very words:
confidence, rely, trust and power.
6. Egypt had made its one attempt to redeem its promises
(28:14) and its army had been beaten at El Tekeh. The Rabshakeh had himself seen this, but his words are more far-reaching
and damaging, exposing the criminal stupidity of Judah’s leaders:
surely, he said, they knew that anyone who ever trusted Egypt
suffered for it, confirming Isaiah’s assessment that to ally with
Egypt is to sign one’s own death warrant (28:15).
7-9. Hezekiah had centralized religious observance (2 Ki.
18:1-7; 2 Ch. 29 — 31). The closure of country sanctuaries
(however correct) would not have passed without opposition and
criticism. The Rab-shakeh knew how to.play on the nerve-ends of
any who were less than convinced by what the king was doing.
He then tries to bargain with horses (8), which were always in
short supply in Israel.
10. It would seem that behind this statement there must lie
some knowledge of what Isaiah had been saying (e.g. 10:5-6).
Spies are not a modern invention. This land: the account in 2
Kings 18:25 reads ‘this place’. This difference is inexplicable if
the Isaiah-account is dependent on Kings. Isaiah’s deep Zioncentred theology would never have permitted ‘place’ to become
land. The second Assyrian speech: a popular appeal for peace
(36:11-21). The Rab-shakeh ignores the politicians and goes
straight to the people, reminding them (12) that rulers declare war
but citizens suffer it. It is an understandable ploy to advise
against trusting Hezekiah or the Lord (14—15); it is a plausible
move to offer a new home instead of the horrors of a siege (16-
17), but the Rab-shakeh made his cardinal error in equating the
223
ISAIAH 36:11 — 37:4
Lord with other gods and in scorning his power to save (18-20).
11-12. Aramaic was the language of the diplomatic service,
but the Rab-shakeh sweeps it aside and addresses the ordinary
people, the men sitting on the wall, literally ‘the inhabitants on
the wall’. Like you should be ‘with you’, implying ‘as long as
they maintain their insane attachment to you and your policies’.
In one sentence he would scare the citizens and alienate them
from their leadership. : 13-17. He was well informed, seemingly, about Isaiah’s
ministry and the emphasis on the way of faith, for why else
should denial of the viability of trust figure so prominently in his
argument. 7rust is the vocabulary of Isaiah (30:15); deliver is the
promise made to Hezekiah (38:6ff.). The Rab-shakeh was pressing for a quick solution. 37:9 shows that Sennacherib did
not want a long war in western Palestine — maybe his position at
home was not as yet totally secure. He makes his offer sound as
attractive as possible: an unmolested present (16) and an
agreeable future (17). He cannot hide the well-known Assyrian
policy of deportation, but he does his best to sweeten the pill.
18-21. Here comes the fatal error, the word of blasphemy
which the Lord heard (37:7). Hamath ... Arpad, see 10:9;
Sepharvaim is of unknown location.
The king’s reaction: faith at last! (36:22 — 37:7). The king
reacts at once with penitence and turning to the Lord (1). A
deputation is sent to Isaiah (2) eating humble pie (3), noting the
element of blasphemy and asking prayer (4). Isaiah, however,
does not pray nor make any new approach to the Lord: the word
of the Lord, once given, stands (5-6): the Lord will remove both
threat and threatener (7).
1. We are not told what transpired between Hezekiah and the
Lord on this occasion. We are told only how he went — with the
torn clothes and sackcloth of penitence, and that he went to the
‘house’ of the Lord, the place where the Lord lived among his people and is always to be found.
—4. The implication is that what the deputation was to say to the prophet expressed the essence of what Hezekiah would say to the Lord. First, there was admission of failure (3). Distress is the fact of adversity; rebuke acknowledges that the trouble was merited; disgrace notes the public shame which followed; and children ... deliver is the frustration of all that was planned, helplessness to accomplish. Hezekiah’s sackcloth (1) was not an unreal show! Furthermore, when Hezekiah goes on to plead for help he bases nothing on his own needs. It is as though he is so ashamed and so aware of failure and helplessness that he rules
224
ISAIAH 37:5-9
himself out of the picture, for, secondly, there is the Lord’s
honour (4). The living God is a striking example of the idiom of
indefiniteness for the sake of emphasis: ‘a living God’. The
indefinite article throws all emphasis forward on to the adjective.
The Rab-shakeh has enumerated the idol-gods of the heathen and
of Samaria (36:18-20), but here is a God belonging to a different
category of being, ‘a /iving God’. Will not the Lord now stand by
his own dignity (cf Nu. 14:11-16; Dt. 9:28; Jos. 7:8-9)? Thirdly,
Hezekiah mentions the needs of the Lord’s people (4), the
remnant that still survives, or ‘that happens to be here’. City after
city has fallen to Sennacherib and long lines of deportees are
already snaking their bitter way into exile — and it is all
Hezekiah’s fault! He followed the lunatic policy of rebellion and
was bewitched by Egyptian promises. He might as well have sold
his people himself. But even when a matter is our own fault we
can still pray about it. And the Lord can always be trusted to pity
his people (cf Nu. 14:17-20).
5—7. Hezekiah’s officials came to ask Isaiah to pray (4), ever
one of the. functions of a prophet (Gn. 20:7; 1 Sa. 7:5; Je. 11:14;
14:11), but he neither prayed nor sought the Lord. He took for
granted that what the Lord had already said he meant (Nu.
23:19). Therefore he can respond at once with a word of
assurance (6) and a promise of action (7). Underlings: a
deliberately belittling expression, ‘the king of Assyria’s lads/
flunkies’. How Isaiah must have delighted to cut the Rab-shakeh
and the king of Assyria’s other officials (2 Ki. 18:17) down to
size! What pomposity of title and verbiage — and what were they
but boys at the beck and call of Sennacherib! J am going to put ...
cut down ...: here is real sovereignty — and over the mightiest
powers on earth at the time. Spirit: cf. 19:14; 29:10 (1 Ki. 22:21-
23; 2 Thes. 2:11; Rev. 17:17). Those who merit delusion are
visited with error. Report: see verse 9 below.. The Lord is
sovereign in Egypt as well.
i. The second Assyrian embassy: the godly king (37:8-35).
We learn here of the withdrawal of the Rab-shakeh from
Jerusalem and Sennacherib’s letter to Hezekiah (8-9), the letter
itself (10-13), Hezekiah’s reaction (14—20) and Isaiah’s reaction
(21-35). The crisis continued, but was resolved, on the human
level, by prayer and the word of God. 8-9. Did Hezekiah reply to the Rab-shakeh’s speech? Maybe
we can find the germs of a reply between the lines of verses 10—
13. But however this may be, the Rab-shakeh heard of the royal
move from Lachish to Libnah, ten miles north. This was itself
225
ISAIAH 37:10-13
occasioned by a report the king heard that Egypt was again on
the march, and the northward move must surely indicate that, in
the face of a lengthening Palestine campaign, Sennacherib
thought it best to begin to withdraw homewards. Tirhakah, here
called ‘king of Cush’, was the sixth Pharaoh in the twenty-fifth,
‘Ethiopian’, Dynasty in Egypt.'-In 701 BC he would have been
twenty years of age, and he acceded to the Egyptian throne in
690. If NIV is correct in introducing a reference to King of Egypt
here, it will be a proleptic attribution of the title by which Tirhakah was later and better known. The likelihood of an
Egyptian intervention after the battle of El Tekeh was small,
though obviously, from Sennacherib’s reaction, not impossible,
but in any event the rumour was divinely inspired. The Lord of history knows when a whispered word is enough for (as the old
prayer says) ‘the hearts of kings are in his rule and governance’.
Hezekiah, man of faith (37:10—-13). Hezekiah is a different
man. As recounted by the Rab-shakeh in 36:6—7, he had been
keeping his powder dry and trusting the Lord (in that order), but
here there is no reference to Egypt, only to (lit.) ‘your god on
whom you are trusting’ (10). Whether or not we can therefore say
that Hezekiah had replied to the Rab-shakeh in terms of simple
trust, that is where he is now seen to stand: a man with a personal
and unequivocal faith. Sennacherib addressed Hezekiah both
verbally (9b, lit. ‘messengers to say’) and in a letter (14). He
attacked his faith (10), asserted the invincibility of Assyria before
nations (11) and gods (12), and hinted at a particular risk to kings
in opposing him (13). It seems clear that Hezekiah was at last
taking seriously the divine promise of deliverance from Assyria
(38:6) and had staked his all on this promise by saying to
Assyria, ‘Jerusalem will not be handed over ...’(10).
11-13. Destroying ... completely (Vhadram): see 34:2, 5. The
word is used of removing something from human contact and
consigning it to God’s possession — or, in Sennacherib’s case, to
the possession of his god. This is the spiritual contest now in
hand: can the city of God be consigned to a god? Gozan ...: all these places are in the Upper Euphrates area, the far north of Palestine. Sennacherib tries to play on Hezekiah’s nerves as king but actually, without knowing it, he is testing the man of faith in another direction. Hezekiah is heir of the Davidic promises. Will he trust the promises that guarantee him as king against the

226
ISAIAH 37:14-20
threats made to him as king? Hamath ..., see 36:19; Hena and Ivwah are unknown.
Hezekiah, man of prayer (37:14—20). In verses 1-4 Hezekiah tore his clothes and asked Isaiah to pray. Now there is no
tearing of clothes and he does his own praying! He knows his
way about in the country of faith. First he commits all to God
(14), and then turns to petition (15-20).
14. It would seem that Hezekiah simply read the letter,
presumably said ‘thank you and goodbye’ to the messengers, and
went off to the Lord’s house. ‘What did he say?’, Sennacherib
will ask them and they will reply, ‘Well ... er ... nothing.’ Isaiah
said truly that he who believes will not panic (28:16; cf. 7:9).
Verses 15-20 contain Hezekiah’s prayer and, as with all Bible
prayers (e.g. Ne. 9; Dn. 9; Acts 4:24—31), this prayer is preoccupied with God: who he is (16), his honour (17), his uniqueness
(18-19) and the revelation of his glory in the world (20).
16-17. The substance of the prayer is not its petitionary
content but its acknowledgment of God. He is omnipotent in his
own person as LORD Almighty (‘Lord of hosts’) and omnipotent
in creation as Maker of heaven and earth; he is God of Israel and
God over all the kingdoms; and, at the centre of verse 16, he is
enthroned between the cherubim. These heavenly creatures were
set at each end of the mercy-seat (Ex. 37:6-9). They formed the
pedestal of the invisible throne of the Lord (Ezk. 1:22—28). The
feet of the enthroned Lord rested on the mercy-seat (Pss. 99:1—5;
132:7). As Ezekiel saw them, the cherubim represented all
creaturely excellence: the lion chief among wild beasts, the ox
among domestic beasts, the eagle among the birds and man as
excellent above all. But this Lord of all is actually present at the
heart of his people’s life, enthroned and yet touching them at the
point of mercy. Living God (17) conveys indefiniteness for the
sake of emphasis, see verse 4. 18-20. Only wood: pagan worshippers would, of course, have
looked beyond the material representation of their gods to the
spiritual force they considered it to represent, but the Old Testament always coolly identifies god and idol. Its monotheism was
so rigorous that it refused to acknowledge any reality beyond the
material (cf. 41:5—7). You alone, O LORD, are God: NIV adapts the
Isaiah text to that of 2 Kings 19:19. In Isaiah, however, Hezekiah
simply says, ‘You alone are Yahweh.’ Just as he identifies the
heathen god with its idol, so in reverse he makes the name of his
God, Yahweh, equivalent to the noun ‘God’: to say ‘Yahweh’ is
to say ‘God’. It both declares Yahweh alone to be God, and also
identifies this only God with Yahweh who saves his people and
227
ISAIAH 37:21-25
overthrows their foes (as once he did, definitively, in Egypt).
Isaiah’s message: Hezekiah, the man of the word of God
(37:21-35). In 36:5 Hezekiah received a word of the Lord in
response to his request for Isaiah’s prayer; here he receives a
word without asking. His commitment to the way of faith opens
the door for him to speak to God: (14-20) and for God to speak to
him (21-35). These two things belong together: Because you
have prayed ... this is the word the LORD has spoken (21-22).
The oracle that follows tells that the whole problem is solved.
Thus the way of believing prayer is the truly practical way of
dealing with the harsh realities of life in this world. What neither
armaments (36:9) nor diplomacy (30:1-2) nor money (2 Ki.
18:13-14) could do, prayer has done. But what the Lord is about to do he had already planned of old (26-29). Here is a mystery of
prayer: it is a way the Lord brings his eternal counsels to pass. He
performs foreordained purposes in answer to the prayers of his people (cf. Mal. 3:1 with Lk. 1:13, 17). Isaiah’s oracle begins
with the fact that prayer was answered by the departure of the
Assyrians (22) and ends (33-35) with the explanation of this fact,
the Lord’s defence of his city. Within these brackets, verses 23—
25 show two ‘sovereigns’ in conflict; 26-29 assert the sov- ereignty of the God who directs history; and 30-32 testify to the faithfulness of that sovereign God to his promises.
21-22, The prayer-answering God. Virgin is used here in the
sense of being untouched by the marauder. The Assyrian came ~
intent on rape but his victim remains unharmed because you have prayed.
23-25, The holy Sovereign. The king of Assyria has exalted
himself as lord of heaven (23, 24ab) and of earth (24c—25).
Raised ... lifted are the verbs of divine exaltation in 6:1 and
doubtless deliberately used here for that reason. The king has
been a preview of ‘the man of sin’ (2 Thes. 2:4). In particular he
has challenged, first, the holiness of the Lord, that is, his
distinctiveness as God; secondly, his particular commitment to be
Israel’s God (23d); and, thirdly, his actual sovereignty as Lord (?“donay, 24b). Alongside this he has registered a personal claim to earthly power (24d) and to dominion over the earth in its heights (24e-h), its remote recesses (24ij), its resources (25ab) and its peoples (25cd). J have dried may be a sidelong glance at the victory at El Tekeh or it may be a perfect of certainty: ‘I am determined to’. With the soles: the Egyptian farmer ran water from the Nile through small irrigation channels into his fields. He could block the flow simply by making a little heap of soil with his foot. The king’s foot is equal to blocking the Nile itself
228
ISAIAH 37:26-29
26-29, The executive Sovereign. Divine sovereignty is
absolute over the course of history (26a-d), over fortified
strength (26ef), over people (27) and over kings (28-29).
26. Ordained: literally ‘did’, a perfect of certainty: so settled
was the plan that it could be spoken of as already accomplished.
Planned is the potter’s verb Vyasar, ‘to mould, shape’. Brought it
to pass: the plan as conceived in the divine mind (26ab) and
moulded by his hands on the wheel of historical events (26c) is
precisely what happened at the end (26d). The facts of human
history are the plan of God (45:7; Am. 3:4-7; 4:6-11). Cities
symbolize humankind’s attempt to achieve security and
community, to organize the world without recourse to God (cf.
24:10; Gn. 11:1—9), but, as in Genesis 3, not even supreme efforts
to throw off the ‘yoke’ of God alter his sovereignty one whit. The
you who did it is the Assyrian king; but the plan (26ab), the
procedure (26c) and the agency (26d) are the Lord’s.
27. To the Assyrian king people were only plants in the field,
not persons but a crop to be reaped for self-advantage; tender ...
shoots, helpless under the Assyrian boot; grass sprouting, of no
more ultimate significance than weeds. The world of powerpolitics is a sad place for people to live in. Imperial glory is
always at the expense of the rank and file. But even here the eye
of faith is taught to acknowledge that a sovereign God is at work,
achieving pre-planned purposes, holy, moral and just in all his
ways (10:5-15).
28-29. Not even Sennacherib is outside divine sovereign
management! His life (28ab) and thoughts (28c) are known, and
it is these inner factors that in particular invite and excite divine
punitive reaction (29ab). Rage (Vragaz): to be in agitation (cf. Ps.
2:1). Insolence: ‘complacency’ (as in 32:9, 18), here the king’s
bland assumption of omni-competence. My hook is cruelly apt
for, according to the monuments, this is the way Assyria led its
captives away. As they did, so it shall be done to them: that is the
way the world is under God. My bit is Isaiah’s very apt
illustration of the relation between the sovereignty of God and
the real power of sinful emperors: all the energy, brute strength,
even violence, belong to the horse; all the wisdom, direction,
purposefulness, the guiding touch, belong to the rider (cf 10:5—
15). Return by the way you came: this is the absoluteness of
divine sovereign direction. The king came on the Lord’s errand
and he is limited to that; he cannot take a step out of that way.
Divine sovereign rule is not just the broad sweep and general
thrust of things; it is the detail, the fine print of history.
30-32, The faithful sovereign. In case anyone should think
229
ISAIAH 38:30-35
that the Assyrian destruction and withdrawal were just happy
chance, Isaiah adds a sign, a visible token that it was the Lord at
work. For two years, owing to the Assyrian invasion, agriculture
was impossible, yet the land would, of itself, produce enough
until in the ¢hird year normal tillage could be resumed.
30. Grows by itself (sapiah): see Leviticus 25:5, 11. What
springs (Sahis) is found only here and in 2 Kings 19:29, and
seems to mean self-set seed (e.g. just as in a garden potato crop
some small potatoes remain undug and ‘set themselves’ to grow
the following year). The invasion prevented sowing in 702 BC,
but when the threat lifted in 701 they would find sufficient
growth to preserve life; in 701 the withdrawing Assyrians still inhibited agriculture, yet in 700 there would still be enough through
‘chance growth’. Thus the Lord would confirm retrospectively
that it was his hand that dispersed the threat. Vineyards: viticulture needed years of patient care (5:2; 7:25; Lv. 19:23—25; Dt. 20:6). Zechariah 8:12 calls the vine ‘the seed of peace’, because
it required conditions of peace to come to fruitage.
31. This vitality in nature pictures the vitality of the people
who will enter a time of security (take root) and prosperity (bear
fruit). How gracious is the moral sovereignty of the Lord! Isaiah
knew the nation was doomed even before Assyria attacked
(22:14; 31:6) yet, belatedly, Hezekiah repented (36:1) and
believed (37:10), and the Lord would not let this go unrewarded (fl Ki ia7ik):
32. Remnant: the word always looks beyond immediate
experiences to the fact that the Lord will always preserve a
people for himself. His zeal — his wholehearted commitment —
will see to this, and his sovereign power as the LORD Almighty,
Yahweh of hosts, will guarantee it.
33-35, The preserving God. Sennacherib will neither
approach (enter is ‘come to’), nor threaten either from a distance
(arrow) or at close quarters (shield, ramp). He is hemmed in to
the divinely imposed path and will return as he came. He is under
the Lord’s control; the city is under the Lord’s care. Thus what 38:6 offers as a promise and 37:21-22 sees as an answer to prayer is here a divine decision based on motives interior to the divine nature (for my sake) and on long-standing covenantal undertakings (for ... David).
iii. The finale: Assyrian overthrow (37:36-38). Isaiah foretold the breaking of Assyrian power in Judah (14:24-27) and this is how it happened. Light on the event from outside the Bible is sparse, for it was not the Assyrian way to record disasters. All
230
ISAIAH 37:36-38
we know is that a divine act of massive proportions, performed
with consummate ease, settled the issue and provided a crowning
proof of Isaiah’s contention that the Lord is master of history and
that the way of faith is effective in the affairs of this life.
36. The angel of the LORD: it would better reflect the rest of
the Old Testament if this were printed ‘the Angel of the Lorp’,
for among many angels there is one special personage. He is the
Lord, and yet he is distinct from the Lord (Gn. 16:7, 11; Jdg.
13:21—22); and he combines in himself divine holiness and divine
condescension (Ex. 23:20—23). (Cf Gn. 22:11ff.; Ex. 3:2ff;
Jdg. 2:1ff.; 13:2ff.; Is. 63:8-9; Ezk. 44:2; Ho. 12:4 [cf Gn.
32:24ff.]; Zc. 1 — 6 [cf 1:12-13 with 3:6-10]; Mal. 3:1.) Isaiah,
then, brings together five major divine manifestations: the word
(31:2), the Spirit (30:1; 31:3; 37:7), the hand (31:3), the arm
(30:30) and the angel. The Lord is ‘the Lord of hosts’.
37-38. Sennacherib ... returned: although he reigned for
another twenty years, he never again campaigned in Palestine:
that road was closed to him. He was assassinated in 681 — and
maybe Isaiah lived to see this final stroke and to note the
distinction between ‘a living God’ who hears prayer and in whose
house king Hezekiah began to find his true security, and a god of
wood and stone in whose house king Sennacherib met his death
(38). Addrammelech is mentioned outside the Bible as
Ardamulissi. The Babylonian Chronicle records the assassination
of Sennacherib and the accession of Esarhaddon.
THE BOOK OF THE SERVANT (38 — 55)
V. HEZEKIAH AND THE WAY OF FAITH: THE DECISIVE SIN (38 — 39)
We are never allowed to know in advance the full significance of
our decisions, and sometimes the simplest acts are discovered by
hindsight to have had, for good or ill, the most far-reaching
consequences. In 1 Samuel 14 Jonathan’s individual assault on a
Philistine outpost (1) issued in a local victory (14), spreading
panic among the Philistines (15), the break-up of the invading
armies (16), the restoration of compromisers (21), the return of
exiles (22) and a resounding feat of arms (31) which (30) could
have been even more decisive. Of this Jonathan knew nothing in
advance. Or again, David lightly committed adultery with Bathsheba (2 Sa. 11:3—4) and in a chilling ‘Mr Fixit’ spirit set about
covering his tracks (6-24). Did he know in advance that this one
act would lead to rape and murder within his family (13:14, 28),
the exile and subsequent rebellion of Absalom (13:38; 15:1ff.),
231
ISAIAH 38 — 39
disruption in the kingdom (20:1ff.) and, in the end, David’s own
last days as a toothless tiger (1 Ki. 1) who left to Solomon a
horrifying testament (1 Ki. 2:1-10, esp. 5-6)? Sarin cete
We must read Isaiah 38 — 39 (cf. 2 Ki. 20) with this in mind.
The tale is simply told: in his terminal illness (38:1) Hezekiah
prayed for healing and the Lord replied with a double promise
(5-6): first, that Hezekiah would recover and live a further fifteen
years; secondly — a divine promise added in sheer grace — that
king and city would be delivered from Assyria. So serious were
these promises in the Lord’s mind that he confirmed them with a
most remarkable sign (7-8). Indeed, in 2 Kings the divine promises are attested by a double sign: not only the sign in the sun as
in verses 7-8 (2 Ki. 20:8-11), but also the notable sign that,
coming out of a terminal illness, the king would go to the Lord’s
house ‘on the third day’ (2 Ki. 20:6), i.e. the day after tomorrow.
It is hard to think that promises could have received greater
confirmation, both objective and subjective, or could, at that
moment, have struck home to Hezekiah with more confidence.
He would be personally healed and politically delivered!
But Scripture is very plain that our grip upon the promises of
God does not go untested (Lk. 8:12—14; 1 Thes. 1:5—6; 2:13-14;
3:5), and so it was with Hezekiah. The testing came in the form
of messengers from Merodach-Baladan (39:1). To the Assyrians
Merodach-Baladan was a terrorist; to himself he was a freedomfighter with his life devoted to the liberation of his beloved
Babylon from Assyrian tyranny. He was remarkably successful.
For twelve years from.722 BC he secured Babylonian independence and reigned as king, and the loss of his kingdom at the
hands of Sargon did not cool his ardour in his great cause. The
conglomerate empires of the ancient world held together only
while the emperor himself kept a firm grip on government.
In consequence, the death of the emperor signalled a relaxing
of central control and an opportunity to break free. Just as
Merodach-Baladan had capitalized on the death of Shalmaneser in 722 BC, so he was ready for the death of Sargon, which hap- pened in 705.' Thanks to Merodach-Baladan’s careful planning, both east and west of the Assyrian empire rebelled. Hezekiah was part of this great scheme. Taking opportunity from the king’s recovery, Merodach-Baladan sent ‘sick visitors’ with a gift — and a letter (39:1). We are not told what the letter contained, but we do know how Hezekiah reacted, giving the
sete further information on Meroch-Baladan, see D. J. Wiseman, NBD, pp.
252
ISAIAH 38: 1-3
envoys a conducted tour of his store-rooms, money and arsenals
(2). The letter was manifestly an invitation to become a partner in
a rebellion, and Hezekiah fell for it.
Isaiah 36 — 37 has already recounted the historical consequences: the tragic suffering of Judah and the eleventh-hour
triumph of grace. Isaiah 39:3—7 explores the spiritual significance
of Hezekiah’s act, the far-reaching consequences of a single
decision. For we must ask, ‘What should Hezekiah have said to
the envoys?’ The answer is plain: ‘Thank you for coming and
thank Merodach for his gift and invitation, but the fact is I have a
divine promise to lean on; it has been confirmed personally in my
return to health and cosmically in the sign of the sun. I cannot
turn from faith in the promises of God.’ But he did turn — and
Isaiah responded with impeccable logic: you want to commit all
you have to Babylon, therefore all you have will go to Babylon
(3-7; Rom. 6:16).
The ‘shape’ of the section helps us to see its meaning:
A! (38:1a) Hezekiah faces death
B' (38:1b) Isaiah ... went ... said ... the LORD SAYS ...
C! (38:8-22) Hezekiah’s dedication
C? (39:1-2) Hezekiah’s defection
B? (39:3-7) Isaiah ... went ... said ... the word of the
LORD ... A? (39:8) Hezekiah faces life
There is nothing in all this to warrant any scepticism about the
historicity of the events.’ Merodach-Baladan figures precisely in
the character revealed outside the Bible; Isaiah acts and reacts
exactly as the rest of his book would lead us to expect and as a
prophet, in the most up-to-date understanding of a prophet’s role,
should; and Hezekiah is still the good-hearted, human person
trying to handle a job that is above his ability.
a. One prayer, two answers (38:1-8)*
1-3. Did Isaiah’s bedside manner leave much to be desired?
1 Contrast Clements, Isaiah 1 — 39, pp. 288-289. 2 Mauchline proposes 710 BC as the date for Hezekiah’s illness but does not
explain how this harmonizes with the 15 extra years promised to Hezekiah.
Hezekiah’s death, dated about 687, would provide a date in the region of 702 BC
when Meroch-Baladan was in his second period of rule in Babylon. Maybe, if this
were the case, he was trying to foster a western rebellion to relieve the pressure he
was under.
233
ISAIAH 38:4-8
Surely he spoke sensitively as well as seriously to the king, with
tears as much as with candour, and his frankness brought benefits
that medical equivocation would not have done. Hezekiah was
displeased (face to the wall; cf. 1 Ki. 21:4), yet he turned to
prayer and shed tears. When the Lord replied (5), he only alluded
to the fact of prayer and the~evidence of tears; he did not
comment on Hezekiah’s mistaken reliance on his claim to
steadfastness in action (walked ... faithfully) and inner integrity
(wholehearted devotion). It is a measure of the Lord’s mercy that
he hears prayer even when it rests on a false assumption like the
bargaining power of good works. 4-6. 2 Kings 20:4 explains the need for Go and tell. The
ground of answered prayer is not human faithfulness but divine
faithfulness. The Lord had made promises (2 Sa. 7:16) to David
and his house and he would not go back on them, yet he also
says, I have heard your prayer. It is in answer to the prayers of
his people that the Lord performs his faithful mercies and keeps
his promises (Lk. 1:13). But the answer exceeds the implied request (Eph. 3:20): the Lord addresses the specific need in the
promise of fifteen years, but then he runs beyond it to meet needs
that Hezekiah had not mentioned, i.e. the deliverance of both
king and city from Assyrian power, that is to say, the restoration
of Davidic sovereignty, the end of puppet status, and Judah as a
nation once again. Significantly at this point 2 Kings 20:6 adds
‘for my sake and for the sake of my servant David’ — an implicit
rebuke to Hezekiah’s appeal to self-righteousness. The Lord’s
mercies rest on the.surer foundation of his purposes and promises.
7-8. Textual uncertainties' in verse 8 do not imperil the reality
of the sign. The stairway of Ahaz may have led to his ‘upper
room’ (2 Ki. 23:12). By accident or design its steps were a sunclock. The sign confirming the double promise was that the
shadow would recede. It would be as improper to suggest how
this was done as to deny what is recorded. The Creator is master
of his creation and even time is his created servant (Jos. 9:12—
14). Ahaz was the king who was invited to ask for a sign moving
_ _! Lit. “Look, I am going to bring back the shadow [masc.] on the stairs which it [fem.] has gone down on the stairs of Ahaz by the sun [fem.] back ten stairs. So the sun returned ten stairs on the stairs which it had gone down.’ It is simple to change bassemes (by the sun) to hasSemes, the sun, providing a subject for the following verb. The curious ‘ten stairs on the stairs’ may be an accidental repetition, which then required the adjustment of an original definite article to a preposition, ‘on’. But, as so often, uncertainty of detail does nothing to obscure what the text means.
234
ISAIAH 38:9-11
heaven and earth (7:11) to vouch for the Lord’s commitment to
the house of David (7:12). It was fitting that the Lord should
provide just such a sign of his faithfulness to David’s house and
city. The least requirement of the verse is that the shadow moved
— and did it then resume its former position? But in any case, a
miracle of God was performed in confirmation of the double
promise. The deliberate linking of Hezekiah and Ahaz at this
juncture is itself a warning to Hezekiah that he stands where his
father stood, at that perilous crossroads where the way of faith
and the way of works, trusting God and self-reliance, meet. And,
like Ahaz, if he will not believe, he will not continue (7:9).
b. Death and life (38:9-22)
Isaiah had access to Hezekiah’s ‘papers’ (2 Ch. 32:32) and
therefore to this ‘writing’ (9). This would not, of course, by itself
have made him include it here. The fact is rather that the psalm
has a part to play in the plot of these two chapters by providing
essential background to chapter 39 and the decision Hezekiah
made there. The psalm’s title (9) is (lit.) ‘when he was sick and
lived/returned to life from his sickness’. It is the writing of a
man who knew he had been under sentence of death — who felt he
was about to die under divine wrath (13), without hope (17), with
sin unforgiven (17); who knew prayer had been heard (14), by an
act of God (15); and who in response to his healing had made his
commitment for the future (15). It was to this man, with this
experience of the Lord and with this personal commitment, that
Merodach-Baladan’s offer came. When, then, he made the wrong
decision, it flew in the face of the proved promises of God (38:7— 8) and of Hezekiah’s own assessment and response to his
experience. 10-11. Death (NIV mg. ‘Sheol’): the place of the departed
(5:14; 14:9). Sorrow over ‘untimely’ death is not peculiar to the
Old Testament (see Phil. 2:27). Throughout the Bible this life has
its unique preciousness which not even the illumination of immortality in Christ (2 Tim. 1:10) takes away. Hezekiah does not
write that he will never see God or humankind again, but that the
relationships formed in the land of the living are terminated by
death. The LorD is the affectionate diminutive ‘Yah’ (as 12:2,
etc.). Living involves an alteration of MT to read heled, ‘world’,
instead of hedel, which is a noun derived from the verb ‘to
cease’, hence ‘cessation’, but which appears nowhere else. If
hedel is retained, then beyond this life Hezekiah sees himself as
‘with those who dwell in cessation’ — still alive but this life has
ceased.
235
ISAIAH 38:12-17
In verses 12-14, four pictures set the scene: how fragile is life
(12a), how decisive is death (12b), how hostile the Lord has
proved (13), and what a feeble thing prayer seems to be (14).
These represent Hezekiah’s feelings as he waits at ‘the gates of
Sheol’ (10). , ‘
12. House: literally ‘encampment’. This life has no more fixity
or solidity than a tent (2 Cor. 5:1). Taken: literally ‘taken captive’.
Death has come in like a conqueror. Weaver ... loom: once the
full pattern has been woven, the thread is snipped off and the
tapestry rolled up. Notice, however, J ... he: the individual weaves the pattern of his life; the Lord determines the time
allowed for the weaving. Day and night: ‘from day to night’, an
idiom of imminent action implying ‘before the day is out’. Made
is either ‘make’ or ‘will make’. Either way, it acknowledges that
the moment of death, ever imminent, is God’s decision.
13-14. I waited patiently: better ‘I composed myself’. The
sick man came through another day and settled himself as best he
could for the night but found no cessation of divine hostility.
Hezekiah is not teaching that sickness itself is a divine hostility,
but that, in his case, he knew it to be such. As death approached
apace he sensed himself to be under the wrath of God, but cf
verse 17. J cried is ‘I keep chattering on ...” The only way to flee
from God is to flee to him. Hezekiah kept up an endless stream of
intercession, but, apart from sounding as ineffective as birds
chattering, he grew weak because of the effort. It says much for
Hezekiah, then, that the cry continued, Lord, come to my aid,
literally ‘go bail for me’ — the one who stands by me when my
resources fail. Prayer seems unavailing (14ab) but is not;
weakness, far from excusing prayerlessness, is a call to prayer
(14c); our need is a ground of appeal for divine aid (144d).
15-17. The difficulties presented by the highly allusive
wording of verses 15—16 do not obscure the general movement of
thought. Hezekiah has been ‘at death’s door’ (10-11), despairing
of life but persevering in a simple prayer (12-14). So what can he
now say (15a)? In his recovery he discerns the voice (he has
spoken) and act (he has done) of God (15b). The lion (13b) heard
the coo of the dove (14b), spoke the healing word (Ps. 107:20) and performed the healing act (15b). Hezekiah cannot explain answered prayer (What can I say?) but he can see the point of it all: because of this anguish his life will now be different — I will walk humbly, not as a superficial reaction, but a lasting commitment all my years. Interestingly the phrase all my years only occurs here in the Bible, the customary phrase being ‘all my days’. But it was to Hezekiah that the Lord said (in the
236
ISAIAH 38:18-19
memorable, if unintended, rhyme of the Authorized Version), ‘I
have heard thy prayer; I have seen thy tears; behold, I will add
unto thy days fifteen years’ (5). It is these years that he now
responsively consecrates. But (16) there is a lesson here for
everyone: by such things, i.e. by suffering faced in prayer, by the
Lord’s answer to prayer, and by responsive commitment. Here is
a way of life all should practise, and (16b) Hezekiah can vouch
for it in his own experience: his spirit has found life and vigour
along this line. Let me live is too weak: ‘You gave me health and
made me live’ — that is, when, in suffering, I called out of
weakness for your strength. Thus (17) suffering is purposeful.
For Hezekiah it brought, first of all, personal benefit (17ab). The
suffering was intense (such anguish) but it was for my benefit,
literally for wholeness, well-being, peace (Heb. salém). Secondly, it brought a special awareness of the Lord’s love (17cd).
The Lord has been his deadly foe, as menacing as a J/ion (13);
what then brought him back from the edge of that awful pit?
What else but your love! The word Vhdsaq is the love of
passionate delight and longing (Gn. 34:8; 1 Ki. 9:19; cf Dt. 7:7;
10:15) — ‘You have loved my soul out of the pit’ (lit.). Thirdly, he
knew the forgiveness of sins (17ef). How can the hostility of
divine wrath (13) change to the yearning of divine love (17cd)?
The first word of 17e is the explanatory ‘For’ (translated ‘Surely’
by NIV). The great change takes place when sin has been dealt
with. (Cf 12:1-2, where ‘salvation’ is the middle term between
anger and comfort.) Hezekiah does not explain how this has
happened, he knows only that it has: his sins (see 1:4) no longer
stand between him and God because God has himself (lit.)
‘hurled’ them behind his back (Mi. 7:18-19).
In verses 18-20, in a beautifully rounded way, Hezekiah
brings his ‘writing’ to a conclusion. Verses 18-19, with their
theme of returning to life from the brink of death, match 11 with
its theme of sinking from the land of the living into the ‘land of
cessation’; verse 20 finds Hezekiah in the ‘house of the Lord’,
matching 10 where he was about to go through ‘the gates of
death’. These contrasts bring into focus the whole movement of
the psalm from death to life. 18-19. When Hezekiah says that the grave [Sheol, NIV mg.]
cannot praise you, he is not, of course, making a comment on
death as such but on the sort of death he would himself have
experienced, death under divine wrath with sin unforgiven.’ In
1 Pss. 6:5; 30:9; 88:10-12 are often understood to teach that the OT lacked
hope after death. In each case, however, the context (like Hezekiah’s ‘writing’) is
237
ISAIAH 38:20-22
such a death there is no hope, no continuing, joyful relationship
with God (18ab), no future to look forward to, bringing experience of divine faithfulness (18cd). The initial For makes this the
explanation of the Lord’s saving mercies to Hezekiah. The Lord
finds no pleasure in such a death; rather it is ‘to the praise of his
glorious grace’ (Eph. 1:6) that he has devised and bestowed his
saving mercies, the love which kept me from the pit (17). Praise
(19), therefore, is the mark of the saved. They are the truly living
(note the repetition, designed to emphasize that this is the life that
is life indeed, Jn. 10:10; 20:31; Rom. 5:17). Fathers ... children:
cf, Deuteronomy 6:4-9; 11:18-19; Proverbs 4:1; Ephesians 6:4.
Hezekiah is true to the Bible when, having pledged personal
devotion (19ab), he goes on to pledge parental devotion (19cd).
20. Will save: literally ‘was for saving’. The idiom expresses
‘direction, tendency or aim’.' We might say ‘the Lord was all out
to save me’. Salvation is rooted in the mind and will of God
(Eph. 2:4) and accomplished by the work of God (Tit. 3:4-6). We
will sing: the saved individual (17) at once finds that he belongs
to a whole company of joy. Yet individuality is not lost in the
group, for (lit.) ‘with my music we will make music’. Jn the
temple: rather ‘house’, for that is what the temple was — the
Lord’s house. When the Lord’s people were a camping people,
the Lord commanded them to pitch a tent for him (Ex. 25:8—9).
He is the indwelling God (Ex. 29:42-46). In the same way, when
the Lord’s people became a settled people, the Lord commanded
that they build him a house (2 Sa. 7:13) with the same purpose,
that he might dwell among them (1 Ki. 8:13). When we call our
church ‘the Lord’s house’, we mean that it is a place we go to be
with him; when the Old Testament calls the temple ‘the Lord’s
house’, it means the place where he has come to be with us. The
Lord’s house was a place of atoning sacrifice, because sinners
cannot draw near to the Holy One without the efficacy and shelter
of shed blood. All this lies in the background of Hezekiah’s
statement that we spend ‘all the days of our lives in the house of
the Lord’: salvation is an individual matter (20a); it creates the joyful company of the saved (20b); and initiates a permanent access into the presence and fellowship of the Lord (20cd). 21-22. As one would expect, 2 Kings includes this record of Isaiah’s ‘prescription’ and Hezekiah’s asking for a sign within the
the prospect of death without divine favour. See J. A. Motyer, Affer Death (Christian Focus, 1996), pp. 18-26. 1 Lit. ‘the Lord to save me’, where the Heb. infinitive expresses direction, tendency or aim. See GKC, pp. 114-115.

ADDITIONAL NOTE
flow of the narrative at the appropriate point (20:7-8). (See
Additional Note, below, regarding the abrupt intrusion of the
same material here when, to all intents and purposes, the
narrative has been concluded.) Poultice of figs ... boil (21):
whether Hezekiah’s health problem was a septic ulcer or some
internal poisoning we are not told. Neither do we know whether
figs were in current medical use, or if Isaiah was simply using the
(lit.) ‘lump of figs’ as a visible symbol of the healing power of
God, an ‘acted oracle’. His actual command was to ‘rub it on the
boil’. There is, of course, no contradiction between healing in
answer to prayer (2—5) and healing by means of medicine. There
is no healing apart from the Lord (Ex. 15:27), who retains his
sovereign authority to use or to dispense with ‘means’.' The figs,
coupled with the prophetic word, would have been a visible
assurance to the king that healing was in progress. Coupled with
the visible assurance of the figs, Hezekiah asked for (22) and
received (2 Ki. 20:7—-8) the cosmic sign of the movement of the
shadow on the stairs. We move on, therefore, into chapter 39 in
the light of promises made and vouched for in both ordinary and
spectacular ways. Surely the king was fully equipped to stay in
the pathway of faith ...?
Additional Note on the ‘intrusive’ narrative
at Isaiah 38:21—22
Prayer had been made and answered, and Hezekiah had responded with joyful recognition of the work of God and personal
commitment. The narrative has, therefore, apparently concluded.
Have we here, then, the thoughtless work of some later editor,
taking a bit from 2 Kings, apparently forgotten by his editorial
predecessors, and patching it in regardless of suitability? But,
surely, any such editor would have been skilful enough to make
the insertion at the same point as he found it in Kings: it is never
a satisfactory solution of a problem to ascribe literary idiocy to
the long-dead guardians of the text! But the question then
remains why this double statement (lit. ‘And Isaiah said ... and
Hezekiah said ...”) stands where it does.
Of course, it is reasonable that Isaiah would wish to play down
his part in the healing of the king, slipping it in at the end; and
this might suffice as an explanation, were it not so carefully
balanced with a parallel quotation of the king’s words. The two
‘sayings’ together give the impression of a deliberate pause in the
flow of the narrative: as if to say, ‘Before we go on to what
1B, Webb, The Message of Isaiah (IVP, 1996), p. 156.
239
ISAIAH 39: 1-7
happened next, stop and recall the heart of what has happened
already: this is what the prophet said ... this is what the king
said.’ Taken in this way, the double saying slots into the balance
of the whole narrative of chapters 38 — 39. In 38:1 Hezekiah is
sick and Isaiah came to him, and in 39:1 Hezekiah is well and
Merodach-Baladan’s men came to him; 38:2-3 records the king’s
reaction, and so does 39:2a; in 38:4~-8 the Lord promises deliverance, but in 39:2b Hezekiah embraces a human promise of
deliverance; 38:9-20 is Hezekiah’s affirmation of what the Lord
has done for him and how he responded, and 39:3-4 is Hezekiah’s record of a human approach and how he responded;
38:20-21 is a double statement, ‘And Isaiah said ... and Hezekiah
said’, and this is paralleled in 39:5, ‘And Isaiah said’, and 39:8,
‘And Hezekiah said’.' Each element in this series of contrasts,
therefore, contributes to the sad message of the whole, but none
more than the final contrast in which, in 38:21-22, Hezekiah
receives proved tokens of grace; but, in 39:5—8, he is revealed as
the architect of disaster, shallowly content with his own
immunity.
c. The moment of decision (39:1-8)
1-2. That Hezekiah should have received the envoys gladly is
understandable. It was a proper courtesy responding to a kindly
gesture. But beyond the gesture lay the /etters, the hidden agenda.
Their contents are not divulged but are plain from the king’s ©
reaction. What must the letters have said if they provoked the
response of displaying the resources and armed strength of the
kingdom? From such a source as Merodach-Baladan, only one
thing: ‘Join me in rebellion’ — and Hezekiah fell for it. It was a
clear choice: the promises of God (38:4-8) or the power of man
(39:2), and Hezekiah forgot the promises.
34. But alongside forgetfulness there was pride. Notice the
emphasis in verse 4. The king’s reply to Isaiah’s question begins
From a distant land and ends from Babylon. These are the two
points of emphasis: ‘Imagine them coming all that way to see me! Imagine Merodach-Baladan wanting me as an ally!’ Forgetfulness of the word of God is the prime enemy of faith; pride in one’s own importance runs it a close second. 5-7. Isaiah’s response could not be more bleak: defeat, captivity, exile. But it could not be more just, a perfect quid pro quo. ‘Everything in my palace’, said Hezekiah (4); everything in
' These renderings are literal. NIV accommodates Heb. narrative style to English usage.
240
ISAIAH 39: 1-7
your palace, responded Isaiah (6). ‘Babylon’, said the king (3);
Babylon, responded the prophet. Commentators dispute if Isaiah
could and would have predicted a Babylonian captivity.' It is not
greatly questioned nowadays that Old Testament includes prediction, but what is rightly queried is bare prediction — a mere
forecast of the future designed to satisfy our curiosity about
“what is going to happen’. The forecast must (a) emerge from the
current situation and (b) speak relevantly to that situation. John
the Baptist’s cry, ‘Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near’
(Mt. 3:2), is a perfect example: he addressed his contemporaries;
he told them of the future; he made the future bear on the present.
Plainly Isaiah’s word to Hezekiah fits this framework. First,
Isaiah did not snatch the name Babylon out of the air. The king
spoke it to him before he spoke it back to the king. Isaiah has no
option but to comment on it. Secondly, his message about
Babylon has a direct bearing on the present: to depart from the
way of faith is to walk in the way of destruction (7:9). Babylon
will be his destruction. Thirdly, Babylon was part of the current
map of the world. It was where already a viable alternative to
Assyrian dominance had been established. Merodach-Baladan
had credentials as a world-beater. If Hezekiah interpreted the
prediction as a fairly prompt future Babylonian captivity, there
was nothing in the current political scene to contradict the possibility.* But this brings us, fourthly, to the fact that we are
actually requiring Isaiah to predict something which lay in the
remote future, over a century off, and this point would appear to
have even greater force if we count the ‘Comfort’ of 40:1ff. as
the actual words of Isaiah. Where is the ‘comfort’ in saying that
everything will be fine in 170 years’ time? But just ask another
question: where does Isaiah say anything about ‘over a century’
or ‘in 170 years’ time’? We know by hindsight of the passage of
the years; the prophet says nothing of it, maybe even was ignorant of it! Right from the time of his call he knew there was a
dark power in the offing which would destroy Zion and carry off
its people (6:11—13); he came to know that Assyria would not be
this power (10:5-15; 14:24—21; 29:1-8; 30:31-33); maybe it was
at this very moment that the name of the ‘dark power’ was revealed, when Hezekiah said ‘Babylon’! Isaiah probes no further:
that is where they are going and from where (48:20-21) they will
in due course come back. The message of the future, both in

241
ISAIAH 39:8
judgment and mercy, is inevitable as the prophet faces the king.
8. The prediction in 39:6 is every bit as categorical as the
prediction in 38:1, which was met by prayer, and divine mercy
turned it into blessing. But, in the course of this chapter, works
have replaced faith, man has replaced God, and pride has
replaced humility. When smug self-importance replaces tears and
prayer, the word of God proves its obduracy and accomplishes its
grim purposes.
VI. UNIVERSAL CONSOLATION (40:1 — 42:17)
The division of the Bible into chapters and verses is a practical
help, but it is not original to the text, and to fail to ‘read straight
through’ is often to miss important meanings. It is worth
remembering that in Q*, the Dead Sea Scroll of Isaiah, what we
call Isaiah 40:1 begins two lines from the bottom of the column
where 39:8 ends, without any suggestion of a break or a new
beginning.
It is remarkable that the word of doom (39:5—7) and the word
of comfort (40:1) lie side by side. No sooner is just judgment
pronounced than (an equally) just comfort is heralded. Indeed,
while one voice speaks the word of doom (39:5ff.), the plural
imperatives of 40:1 summon a company of comforters out of
which three voices are heard speaking (40:3, 6, 9) so that the
comfort is more abundant than the condemnation. And not only .
so, but while judgment comes on one sinful nation (39:5ff.), the
ue as we shall see, spreads out to embrace the whole world.
a. Consolation for the Lord’s people (40:1 — 41:20)
The message of comfort begins where the need for it is sharpest.
The situation fits with what we know of Isaiah, who, following
his word to the king regarding exile to Babylon, would inevitably
find himself at the sharp end of questioning by his discipleship
group (8:16): if the days of the monarchy are numbered — all
deported to Babylon and the males of the royal family eunuchs — what about the great royal promises which have been the substance of the prophet’s ministry to date (e.g. 9:1-6; 11:1-16)? Plainly Isaiah must either tear up his earlier prophecies or else seek further truth regarding the future.
Further truth indeed he did seek, and he sets it out in a beautifully balanced statement: three voices proclaim promises of comfort (40:1-11); the promises are then guaranteed by the nature of the Lord who, as Creator (40:12-31), rules the whole
242
ISAIAH 40: 1-2
creation and cannot forget his people (40:25-31) and, as Lord of
history (41:1—7), directs the whole historical process, raising up
the world’s rulers (41:14), and exposing the world’s idolatries
(41:5—7); finally, matching the three voices (40:3-11), there are
three pictures of consolation (41:8—20).
i. The message of comfort (40:1—11)
Introduction: the heralds of comfort (40:1-2). 1. Comfort,
comfort: the verbs are plural imperatives commanding an
unnamed band to bring comfort to those whom the Lord still calls
my people. They have abandoned him but he has not rejected
them. Like tiny children they have stumbled in the uncertain
paths of the world and will be bruised by their fall, but they have
a God rushing to pick them up in his arms (11).
2. Speak tenderly: ‘speak to the heart’, like a young man
wooing his girl (Gn. 34:3), someone bringing reassurance (Ru.
2:13), a deserted husband seeking to win his wife back (Ho.
2:14). Hard service: the word saba’ means ‘army/host’ (Jdg.
8:6), but extends its meaning to cover a fixed period of service
(Nu. 4:3) or the fixed duration of life (Jb. 47:1), and, here, an
appointed period of hardship. Sin ... paid for: here is the element
of justice that lies behind the word of comfort. How can the God
of judgment (39:5ff.) become the God of pardon? Not just by
saying so — for that would be to treat his holiness as negotiable
and sin as negligible. The verb paid for (Vraza, ‘to be
favourable’) is used of the Lord’s ‘pleasure’ (1 Ch. 28:4) and particularly of the acceptance the Lord accords to atoning sacrifices
(Lv. 1:4; 22:27). It stresses, therefore, not so much that the
sacrifice offered is sufficient to cover the sin committed (though
that has to be true also), but that it satisfies the requirements of
the holy God. Sin (‘awon): the inner reality of the warped, sinful
nature (1:4; 6:7). The word is mainly the fact of ‘iniquity’ but
also, as here, ‘punishment of iniquity’ (Lv. 26:41), the price paid
to deal with sin. Received ... the LORD’s hand: to the sinner it is a
free gift, offered to be ‘taken’; the donor and agent is the Lord.
Hand symbolizes personal agency. The provision for sin is not a
human expedient, hoping for the best that it will work, but a
divine provision (Lv. 17:11; Is. 53:6, 10) and action. Double
(Vkapal) means ‘to fold over, fold in half’ (Ex. 26:9); the noun,
as here (kiplayim), occurs only in Job 11:6, where divine wisdom
is ‘two-sided’ in the sense that it always includes hidden realities
beyond the reach of the human mind. So here, the thought is not
of an excessive punishment running beyond what the case
required, but of a dealing with sin that includes realities beyond
243
ISAIAH 40:3-6b
our comprehension. On the other hand, when something is folded
over, each half corresponds exactly with the other half, and this
would yield the thought of exact correspondence between sin and
payment.' For: i.e. ‘in payment for’. As we will see, it is the task
of the coming chapters progressively to unfold what this payment
will turn out to be. Sins (hatta’t): see 6:7. ;
The message of comfort (40:3-11). Three unnamed voices
obey the call to comfort my people (1). The first voice (3-5) says
that our God is coming to reveal his glory worldwide; the third
voice (9-11) brings this message to bear on Zion: the coming
Lord is the shepherd who will gather his people and lead them
home; the second voice affirms the enduring quality of God’s
word: he has promised universal revelation (5) and good news for Zion (9) and his word will not fail. These truths summarize the
whole message of chapters 40 — 55. The Lord has an interim plan
for the consolation of his exiles in Babylon (43:14; 44:24 —
45:7; 48:20-21), but he also has a second plan, bringing his word
and salvation to them and to the whole world (42:1-4; 49:1-6; 55:1-13).
3-5. A voice, or the exclamatory use of the noun (13:4; 66:6):
‘Listen! Someone is calling out.” Way is not an exodus-type
picture of the Lord’s people journeying home from captivity (see
48:20-21), but the old picture of the Lord’s desert journey to his
people’s aid (Dt. 33:2; Jdg. 5:4; Ps. 68:4, 7); and there is also a
reference elsewhere suited to this context. A Babylonian hymn .
says, ‘Make [Nabu’s] way good, renew his road. Make straight
his path’, referring to.the creation of special processional routes
along which the images of the gods were carried on festivals. The
creation of a road that is straight (3d), unmistakable (highway, or
causeway, 3e), level (4ab) and smooth (4cd) pictures a journey
made without difficulty and therefore with certainty of arrival.
The glory of the LORD (5S) means ‘the Lord in all his glory’, not
necessarily with awesome manifestations but in the fullness of his personal presence. For the mouth: a typically Isaianic
affirmation (1:20; 58:14; also 21:17; 22:25; 25:8), stressing both the origin of the word in the Lord (mouth) and the identity of what the prophet said with what the Lord said.
6ab. A voice: or, as above, ‘Listen, someone is saying.’ And I said adopts the reading of Q* and Lxx and is widely interpreted
''The idea that a tradesman pinned the folded account to the door of the customer once it was paid and that this was called ‘the double’ is more likely to leaded Is. 40:2 than to be an explanation of it. Nevertheless, as a picture it is elpful.
244
ISAIAH 40:6c-11
as hinting at the ‘call’ of ‘second Isaiah’, the supposed author of
chapters 40 — 55. This is a classical example of making the ‘facts’
fit the theory. It is better to follow MT, which reads ‘and he said’
or ‘and someone said’. This matches well the anonymity of the
“voices” in verses 3 and 9. It is the message, not the messenger, that is important.
6c—8. The message is the contrast between human transience
and divine permanence, designed to affirm that what the Lord
promises he will most surely keep and perform. If, therefore, he
promises universal self-revelation (5) and shepherding care (11),
nothing can stop these things happening. Men: literally ‘flesh’,
humankind in its vulnerability. Glory (hesed): the word used (e.g.
54:8, 10) of the ‘ever-unchanging’ faithful love of the Lord for
his people. It occurs also of the love that humans owe back to the
Lord but, by comparison, what a fickle and transient thing that
turns out to be (Ho. 6:4)! The reference is not to our fading
physical ‘glory’ or anything like that but to our moral and
spiritual unreliability. Because the breath: literally ‘spirit’. This
could be a reference to the Holy Spirit. Certainly he is the ‘Lord,
and Giver of life’ (Ps. 104:30), but equally ‘the Lord, and Giver
of death’. Just as the flower fades under adverse conditions, so
the moral and spiritual constitution comes under testing (Mk.
4:16—19). Furthermore, what Isaiah says about ‘all flesh’ (6cd) he
notes to be equally true of those from whom more would be
expected: Surely (lit. ‘Why, even’) the people — the Lord’s
people! — show the same moral instability (are grass). But, by
marvellous contrast, there is a changeless factor at work in the
world: the word of our God (Nu. 23:19; Ps. 119:89).
Verses 9-11 reveal that the promised coming of the Lord (3-4)
will not be in vain. Exile is not the last word for the Lord’s
people — whether the exile in Babylon of old or the continuing
‘exile’ of his scattered people (Jas. 1:1; 1 Pet. 1:1). The homecoming is certain.
9a-f. You who bring: a feminine verb — drawing on the
occasion when Miriam took her tambourine and sang of the
victory the Lord had won (Ex. 15:20; cf 1 Sa. 18:6-7; Ps. 68:11)
— pictures the celebratory company of singing women being led
out of Zion to meet the returning victor-Shepherd. High
mountain, so that all may hear; with a shout, ‘with strength’,
because there is no doubt about the message, nothing to merit
hesitancy. 9g-11. Here is ... See ... See: the same word on all three
occasions, ‘Behold/Look!’ It is all happening before their very
eyes: the divine coming of One who is God, the mighty coming
245
ISAIAH 40:12
of One who is with power (lit. ‘as a strong One’) and the
successful coming of One who brings with him what he has
achieved. The synonyms reward ... recompense describe what he
has ‘earned’ by his victory (cf the victorious David in 1 Sa.
31:20). But, mighty though he is, there is nothing ruthless in his
power. Towards his people it isa power working by love: the care
that tends, the gentleness that makes provision for the weak (the
lambs) and that caters for particular needs (those that have
young). Note the contrast between the ‘ruling arm’ of 10b and the
gathering (lit.) ‘arm’ of 11b.
ii. God the Creator, guarantor of his promises (40:12-31).
This wonderful poem moves to a climax in verses 27-31, the
security of Jacob/Israel under such a God: this sovereignly wise
Creator-God (12-14) blends all things exactly together (12);
in his greatness (15-17) he dominates creation and its peoples
(17); he alone is God (18-20); he rules (21-24) all earthly
‘powers’ (23), and controls (25-26) creation down to the last
detail (26). So how then can Jacob/ Israel, his very own people,
be forgotten (27) or be left without strength (31)? This is one of
the central Old Testament passages on the doctrine of creation. It
teaches that the physical fabric of creation is a direct artefact
of the Creator: dust and waters (12) have been weighed and
measured out in his hand. The presence of organized human
strength (mations, 15, 17) makes no difference to the Creator’s
absolute sovereignty over his creation. The Creator God is the
sole God (18-20), compared to whom all claimants to deity
are but the product of human skill (19-20). The Creator presides
over the inhabited world (22) and rules earth’s rulers (23-24).
With attention to detail he decrees the movements of the
cosmos (26). In one way or another the fourfold Old Testament
doctrine of God the Creator is represented here: he originates everything, maintains everything in existence, controls
everything in operation, and directs everything to the end he appoints.
The Creator in his wisdom (40:12-14). 12. The contrast between waters and dust, heavens and earth exemplifies the Hebrew idiom of ‘totality expressed by contrast’. This Creator God is the creator of all. Measured ... marked out ... held ... weighed: the whole creation is precision work with every component present to the exact amount. Marked off is the verb we would use to express ‘fine tuning’. Hollow ... breadth ... basket ... scales ... balance: in human terms these are the measures we use for small-scale working, here they underline the
246
ISAIAH 40:13-17
immensity of the Creator in comparison to his creation.
13-14. Just as verse 12 was full of words in the toolvocabulary, here is the vocabulary of wisdom: understood ...
instructed ... counsellor ... consult ... enlighten ... taught ...
knowledge ... understanding. There are, of course, shades of
meaning in all these words, but their force lies in their total
impact: the unbounded, unsurpassed, underived wisdom of the
Creator. Understood is the verb translated marked off in verse 12.
The Creator did not need anyone to ‘fine tune’ him! Enlighten ...
right way ... understanding all share the idea of discernment,
seeing to the heart of a matter. In sum, therefore, whether we
view the creation as a task accomplished (12) or whether (13-14)
we go behind the task to the wisdom which planned it, there is
only the one Creator God.
The Creator in his greatness (40:15—17). Isaiah now turns to
the inhabited world. The relationship between the Creator and the
creation (12-14) is ‘asymmetrical’ — that is to say, the Creator has
total power over the creation; the creation has no power over the
Creator. Does the advent of humankind alter this? No, the
relationship is still ‘asymmetrical’! Nations (15, 17) describes
humankind in collective, organized strength but, in relation to the
Creator, they are only a drop ... dust ... nothing ... worthless ...
less than nothing.
15. The omission by NIV of the double ‘Behold’ in this verse is
a loss. ‘Look at this’, says the prophet: a person carries a bucket
of water from the well and a drop splashes out! Does he notice
the loss? A chemist measures out a substance; total accuracy is
important, so he wipes or blows the dust off the pan of his scales.
Now ‘look at this’: to the Creator, total land masses (islands) are
as easy to weigh! The double ‘Behold’ points first to the human,
then to the ‘fabric’. In each case, and equally, the dominance of
the Creator is total.
16. From organized humanity, Isaiah moves to religious
humanity. There is nothing we can do which would adequately
match the greatness of the Creator — not even were we to make
all Lebanon a fire and all its animals a holocaust (Ps. 50:9-13). In
verse 15 we are under his power; in verse 16, he is beyond our
power. Nothing we can do puts him in our debt or at our disposal.
This is the death-knell to all ‘do-it-yourself’ systems of
salvation. Over every human effort to move God, to meet his
demands, satisfy his requirements, manoeuvre him to our
advantage and climb into his ‘good books’, Isaiah simply writes,
‘Not enough.’ 17. Now the prophet turns to all the nations. Suppose the
247
ISAIAH 40: 18-21
whole world became one huge ‘collective’, how would we compare with the Creator? Nothing ... worthless ... less than nothing!
Do these words suggest that humanity ‘means nothing’ to the
Creator? This would not be correct, for, far from ‘meaning
nothing’, Scripture insists that humankind is the crown of
creation, the bearer of the divine image, appointed to the dignity
of vice-regent in the created world (Gn. 1:26-28; Ps. 8). This
verse, then, is not assessing man’s value to God but his comparative stature. Here is the ultimate statement of the ‘asymmetrical’ relationship. Before him: standing ‘in front of him’, humankind’s collective strength is nothing; ‘they are to be reckoned in
comparison to him as non-entity’. He alone possesses life; of
themselves they do not. Less than nothing is the ‘formless’ of Genesis 1:2, meaning ‘lacking evident purpose and meaning’:
‘compared to him they are to be reckoned as pointless.’
The Creator in his sole deity (40:18—20). This topic lies at
the centre of the poem. On each side of it, Isaiah examines the
relationship of the Creator to organized humankind: the nations
(15-17); princes and rulers (21-24). On each side again of those
topics he deals with the Creator and the creation: the wisdom that
planned and the power that executed (12-14); the management
skill that keeps everything in place (25—26). But here, centrally, is
the Lord’s sole deity, the absence of anything that can be called
‘God’. For apart from the God who reveals himself in Holy
Scripture, people are confined to their own thoughts, imaginings
and devisings, a truth most plainly seen in the making of an idol.
Such merely human religion is exposed at two points. In verse 19
the beauty of an idol is that of human artistry and earthly richness, and in 20 the life of the wood (‘a tree’) comes from the soil;
its durability is only that of nature (will not rot), its shape and
‘character’ are the gifts of a skilled craftsman (i.e. human imagination), and its stability something contrived (not topple). The
emphasis throughout is on the human, earthly, origin of such a
‘god’ and the fact that its ‘powers’ cannot extend beyond that
which it naturally is. Note how verse 19 begins and 20 ends with a reference to a crafisman. That says it all; it is a human invention.
The Creator in his role as King of kings (40:21-24). 21. The ‘heaping up’ of questions resembles that in verses 12-14. There the expected answers affirmed only one God who is all-wise; here the expected answers point to a wisdom humans should have — and our culpability if we ignore it. Cf Psalm 19:1-6; Romans 1:20; Hebrews 11:2 — according to which passages there is a ‘voice’ speaking from and about the world, proclaiming that it is
248
ISAIAH 40:22-25
not self-originating. Is it to this ‘voice’ that Isaiah refers when he
asks, Have you not heard? (21b).' What he says is appropriate
enough to ‘natural religion’, but he is actually addressing Israel
and progressively moving to the moment when (27) he can
challenge their failure in faith. They have always known the allwise, omnicompetent Creator (12-14), the unchallengeable Lord
of the nations (15-17), the sole God (18-20) and now the King of
all kings. They had a revelation going back to the very beginning,
and always, as part of the doctrine of creation, they acknowledged a sole (Ps. 96:5) and sovereign (Je. 10:12—-16; 27:56;
32:17-20) Creator God.
22-24. Envisaging his people as destined to be swallowed up
among the nations, dominated by a totalitarian conqueror — all of
which would occupy his imagination following the Babylonian
prediction of 39:5—7 — Isaiah knows how important it is that they
have a theological perspective on the question of earthly power.
Hence he shows them in turn the transcendent supremacy of their
God (22), how earth’s rulers appear when compared with him
(23), and the retrospective judgment of history on them (24). Tent
to live in pictures either the inhabited earth as humankind’s
tent dwelling under the canvas of the sky, with the Creator
exalted over all, or else the greatness of a God who needs the
whole expanse of the sky to provide a tent sufficient for himself.
Either way, the phrase emphasizes his dominance over the world
of people. Naught ... nothing, as in verse 17, express a
comparative judgment. Naught is the word 17 translates as
‘nothing’, and nothing appears there as ‘less than nothing’ (Gn.
1:2, tohui, evidencing no meaning or purpose). In his own
estimation and to those around him, a ruler is a ‘somebody’, but
to the Lord his power and prestige mean nothing; he alone is
King. Like chaff: a picture of that which is quickly dispersed.
History is long as we live through it, brief as we look back.
‘Time, like an ever-rolling stream, /Bears all its sons away;/They
fly, forgotten, as a dream ...’
The Creator in his direct management of the cosmos
(40:25-26). Matching verses 18-20 where the Lord was
incomparable in his deity, here he is incomparable in his role as
‘Managing Director’. 25. The Holy One: His power and wisdom (12-14), greatness
(15-17), deity (18-20) and dominance (21-24) put the Lord

249
ISAIAH 40:26-31
beyond compare, but the killing blow to any comparison is his
holiness, his unique moral majesty (see 6:3). Holiness and
creation often appear side by side (Ps. 104:24-25; cf 93:5). It is
as if the Old Testament found it impossible to meditate on the
Creator and world Ruler without moving intuitively to the
holiness of his rule over the earth. So it is here. Certainly the
Lord’s holiness lifts him out of the realm of comparison with any
other, but is this also a word in season for Israel? In their earthly
need, they can rest in their Creator’s sovereign care, trust his
sovereign wisdom and so on, but it is always the sovereignty of
the Holy One; part of what they need to understand in their plight
is that their guiltiness before such a God merits his holy wrath
and requires their penitence. There is a demanding moral dimension in living in the Creator’s world. 26. The ancient world was just as full as the modern world of
astrologers anxious to tell us how the stars create the conditions
of life. Isaiah, however, would simply have us admire the
Creator’s handiwork and understand the movements of the
heavens (not as exerting influence but) as demonstrating the
wonder and exactness of the Lord’s direct management of his
cosmos. His direction is individual (26c): the stars are like so
many pet dogs called by name to take their place in their master’s
design (26d), and innumerable though they are, their number is
never less than complete (26ef).
The Creator in his self-giving (40:27-31). 27. The questions
expose the frailty of faith and also the absurdity of faithlessness.
First, can my way on earth have become so tangled that the Lord
has lost sight of me? And second, there is no use pleading my
cause before him only for it to be dismissed out of hand. The
particular value of the doctrine of God the Creator is, of course,
that it brings all that is true about God to bear on this world.
Consider, then, the absurdity of losing faith in One who, in
relation to earth, is all-powerful (12), all-wise (13-14), dominant
(15-17), with no god to challenge, check or rival him (18-20),
King of kings (21-24), sovereignly in charge of his world down
to the smallest detail so that everything is in its place, nothing overlooked, nothing lost!
28. These truths are now in principle recapitulated. He is the eae God, therefore there is no time when he is not; the ends of the earth are his, therefore there is re he is 0G nol <a ired ey weary. Ris Siinath dees coiee ieneene inner resources cannot limit him, nor can lack of understanding. 29-31. The string of attributes of the Lord — eternity, omnipresence, untiring strength, wisdom (28) — continues in the
250
ISAIAH 41:1
opening Hebrew participle: he is also one who shares _his
strength, not as a whi asional act but as of e
1s. Weary (29 tired (30) are the same word (translated tired
In 28 i h. Weary
(30) is a different word, pointing to exhausti ecause of the
hardness of life. It is part of the ‘understanding’ (28) of the
unwearying God that he knows our frailty and provides an
antidote. Youths, those in the prime of young life; young men —
from the verb ‘to choose’ — those ‘picked’ out for bodily prowess.
Thus native strength, whether simply natural or specially
cultivated, can fail, but those who hope in the LORD ... renew
their strength. Hope (with, of course, its biblical component of
certainty) is one meaning of Vgawd, which also means ‘wait’
(patiently) and ‘rest’ (trustfully). Here it is a participle, pointing
to a maintained relationship. Renew, from a basic meaning ‘to
change’ (Vhdlap), comes to mean ‘to put on afresh’: here, ‘keep
putting on fresh strength’. It is a different strength, as if people
become eagles, a strength brought about by transformation; it is
divine strength, a strength like the Lord’s own that does not
weary or faint (28e). Run, the exceptional demands of life; walk, the ordinary daily grind. oat
iii. God the world ruler, guarantor of his promises (41:1—
7). Isaiah now turns to bring into sharper focus truths he has
already affirmed in principle: that the Lord dominates nations
(40:15-17), is the Ruler of rulers (40:21—24) and has no rival god
to challenge or hinder (40:18-20). His purpose is the same:
arising from the comforting promises of 40:3—11 and leading into
the comforting pictures of 41:8—20, this truth of the Lord as the
sole director of history serves to guarantee his pledges. The heart
of the passage is the double question Who ...? (2-3 and 4). Even
the most dramatic of earth’s ‘movers and shakers’ owes his career
to the initiatives of the only God. This core truth is bracketed by
a summons to the nations to ponder this truth (1) and an exposure
of the futility of their response to history’s threats (5—7).
The court is convened (41:1). In this opening court scene the
Lord is the Judge, summoning the world before him (lab), but he
is also one of the litigants (lcd), there to argue his case with his
adversaries-at-law. Basic to the use of the courtroom imagery is
the truth that the Lord can and will proceed only on the basis of
absolute justice. Silent: i.e. in recognition of the dignity of the
Judge. Islands: see 11:11; 40:15. Isaiah uses the word ‘iyyim as
shorthand for the far reaches of earth. Renew their strength: the
expression is the same as in 40:31, ‘put on new strength’. There it
251
ISAIAH 41:2-3
was an invitation to return to a position of undoubting faith and
to experience the renewal that faith brings; here it implies that the
same way of renewal is open to the whole world: they too are invited to put their trust in the God of Israel and find new strength.
Thus Isaiah quietly introduces a theme he affirmed in 19:24-25;
27:13, and to which he will return in 41:21 — 42:17; 45:14-25;
55:1-13. Judgment is, as commonly in the Old Testament, not
‘condemnation’ or ‘sentence’ but ‘decision’. The nations are
invited candidly to argue out the case and then to hear the authoritative decision of the court. :
The issue is: who rules the world? (41:2-4). Who is the
conqueror of whom these verses speak? The oldest interpretation
says it is Abraham, referring to his conquest of the kings of the
earth in Genesis 14; most interpreters now think rather of the
coming reference to Cyrus (44:24 — 47:15). The fact is that any
and all views can be accommodated in this non-specific passage
while, at the same time, Isaiah is soon going to apply the
truths sketched here to the particular example of Cyrus. But it is
best to let him spring that on us in his own time and to treat the
present verses as mainly exploring a problem in principle: where
do would-be conquerors come from (2a)? Whose purposes are
they serving (2b)? How are their victories to be explained (2c—
3)? In a word, who really rules the world? Is history a
meaningless jumble of events or is it a plan in the hands of a
master?
2-3. Stirred: literally ‘roused’ as if from sleep, ‘stirred’ to
activity, not motivating someone already on the move but giving
the initial impulse to act. East: the situation is Palestinian, where
every serious incursion had its origin in the east (see 25) in
Mesopotamia. Righteousness: in pursuance of a righteous
purpose. Service: ‘to his foot’ (lit.), a regular idiom meaning ‘to
follow him’. This righteous purpose works out in domination
(hands ... over ... and subdues), total victory (sword ... bow),
invincible progress (pursues ... unscathed) and expanding empire
(not travelled). In a word, Isaiah raises the whole problem of the violence of history: why did it start in the first place? Why is one person allowed to rise to such power? Why is such violence permitted to succeed? Why is it all such a mess? The prophet insists that in every movement of world affairs, the Lord initiates, purposes and achieves, and that all is in accordance with a purpose of righteousness. He does not say that we can ever see that it is so; he teaches that it is. Unscathed (3): ‘in peace’, contrasting the serenity and self-satisfaction of the conqueror with the havoc he creates. Before is an interpretative addition,
a2
ISAIAH 41:4—7
literally ‘the path with his feet he does not come’, possibly
intended to suggest travelling with such speed that his feet do not
seem to touch the ground! — a picture both of expanding sway
and of the easy success that often attends the conqueror’s way.
4. The question of verse 2 is reiterated along with the verdict
of the Judge. The two verbs done ... carried through are more
simply ‘worked ... acted’: what agency lies behind worldshaking events? Calling (omit forth) means either ‘announcing’
(the Lord plans history’s programme), or ‘calling (by name)’ (the
Lord appoints his own agents) or ‘calling on’ (the Lord appoints
the destiny to which history and its agents are moving). (With)
the first (of them) and with the last: the brackets here indicate
where NIV has made additions. MT as it stands affirms the Lord as
the sole Origin (‘The First’) and implies his presiding presence
right through the course of history until at the end he is ‘with the
last’. Jam he may simply be the answer to the question Who ...?
but more likely it expresses the changeless self-consistency of the
Lord (46:4; Ps. 102:27-28) or his unqualified existence (43:10;
48:12), whereas all others live by his will and permission.
The pathetic alternative to the invitation and the verdict
(41:5-7). Universally (islands, see 1; ends of the earth), the only
alternative to the God who reveals himself (J, the LORD ... Iam
he, 4) is man-made gods. Isaiah introduced this topic in 40:19-
20; he pursues it here and it remains one of the major emphases
of chapters 40 — 48. The sequence of thought here is typical:
universal nervousness (Sab) drives humankind into collective
security (Sc, 6ab) and a brotherhood of fear (6b). Out of this
emerges the need to have a ‘spiritual’ power on their side (7) but
the product cannot exceed its source: human skill (7abc), human
approval (7d), human stability (7e). Humankind’s ‘gods’ are only
projections of humankind’s weaknesses.
iv. Three pictures: guaranteed consolations (41:8-20). The
common theme of these three pictures is transformed
helplessness. In verses 8-13 Israel is twice addressed as servant
(lit. ‘slave’), that is to say a person without position or rights —
but this slave belongs to a great master: he is my servant (8-9)
and he has on his side my righteous right hand (10), therefore the
powers ranged against him must fail. In verses 14-16, Jacob is a
worm (14), but by the Lord’s help (14) the worm triumphs over
impossible obstacles (15). In verses 17-20, there is the exodus
imagery of helplessness before the adversity of the desert: terrible
life-threatening thirst. But now the God of Israel comes to the
rescue, transforming circumstances and making creation itself
253
ISAIAH 41:8-13
new. Thus, then, hostile forces are vanquished (8-14), impossible
barriers removed (15-16) and killing conditions transformed (17—
20). And all this through divine action: J will strengthen (10), J
will make (15), I will ... answer (17). In context, therefore, the
three pictures affirm that the divine life promised in 40:31 is not
wishful thinking but a practical reality, even in a world of
superior powers (8-13), colossal difficulties (14-16) and adverse
circumstances (17-20).
Victory for the lowly (41:8-13). 8-9. My servant (8-9): the
great keyword of chapters 40 — 55 makes its first appearance.
Logically we want to know what a servant does, but this passage
tells us nothing of his task. It tells us, first, that Jsrael came to be
the Lord’s servant by divine choice (8b, 9d; Eph. 1:4); secondly,
that the relationship began with Abraham. My friend (2 Ch. 20:7;
Jas. 2:23) is literally ‘my loving one’/‘who loved me’. Thirdly, it
tells us that the extension of the covenant promise to Abraham’s
descendants (lit. ‘seed’, Gn. 17:7) still stands (chosen you ... not
rejected you); and, fourthly, that in his choice and calling of
Abraham the Lord showed that his power extends to the ends of
the earth ... its farthest corners. In all this there is nothing of any
function the servant may perform; only that Israel has an
honoured status. In other words, a slave as such is a social
nonentity, but before you kick him, ask who his owner is!
10-13. It is to this Owner that Isaiah now turns. Just as the
thought of status (expressed by servant) bracketed verses 8-9, so
the thought of safety (do not fear; my right hand ... your right
hand; help) brackets 10-13. Within the bracket, the words
describing opposed forces are in each case emphatic (who rage
.. Oppose ... enemies ... war against, 11-12). Thus all opposition
is held within the embrace of pledged divine presence and help,
and consequently it will come to nothing (disgraced ... perish ...
not find ... nothing at all). The Lord’s presence (with you, 10) and
commitment (your God) are the antidote to fear. Dismayed is to
dart glances this way and that, being at a loss to know what to do
for the best. The Lord, however, is no mere passive companion. His presence brings his active strength, expressed as a mounting tide of assistance: ‘Yes, I will strengthen you; Oh indeed, I will help you; Why, I will uphold you ... !’ For uphold, see Exodus 17:12. My righteous right hand: the hand (40:12) is the organ of personal action; the (lit.) ‘right hand of my righteousness’ is the Lord’s personal action implementing his righteous promises and purposes.
Verses 11-12 express, first, a mounting tide of hostility, Starting with the emotion of rage, moving on to the formulation
254
ISAIAH 41:14-16
of a complaint (oppose you means ‘have a case against you’);
next comes active opposition (enemies is ‘the men of your
struggle’, lit. ‘those who actively oppose you’), leading to open
war. But each verse (11d, 12d) ends with the opposition coming
to nothing. Verse 11 describes this descent to nothingness from
the point of view of the opponents; 12, from the point of view of
the one opposed, pictured as searching for a now non-existent
foe. The Lord’s promises and reassurances (10) are the ground of
actual safety and deliverance (13).
Transformation for the negligible (41:14-16). Here is a
remarkable picture: a worm faced with mountains and hills! An
impossible barrier! But the worm is transformed into a threshingsledge of such mammoth proportions that the mountains are
chopped into chaff and carried away on the wind.
14. Contrasting with human incapacity (worm) in the face of
daunting obstacles, there is, first, personal divine action (J
myself), then, secondly, the affirmed word of divine promise
(declares, lit. ‘[it is] the word of’, see 1:4). Thirdly, the Lorp,
Yahweh, who purposes to act, has already proved both his
willingness and power to do so through the exodus (Ex. 3:15).
Fourthly, he himself undertakes whatever we need: Redeemer is
go él, see 35:10, the Next-of-Kin who takes upon himself his
people’s needs as if they were his own; and, fifthly, God is on the
side of his people in the fullness of the divine nature: the Holy
One of Israel (see 1:4). The title always holds two ideas together:
as holy he possesses the divine nature to the full; as of Israel he
has pledged himself to his people.
15-16. Note the balance between J will make and you will
winnow. The Lord’s transforming power is not meant to
immobilize but to enable his people. A threshing-sledge was a
heavy wooden platform with sharp cutting edges fitted underneath. Thresh the mountains: i.e. tackle the seemingly impossible,
remove the seemingly impenetrable (Zc. 4:7). Wind ... gale: the
‘forces of nature’ are often used as symbols of divine action (Pss.
18:7-15; 104:4). So, here, the Lord who transforms (15a) and
mobilizes (16a) his people leaps in powerfully on their side to
scatter and remove what stood in their way. The LORD ... the
Holy One of Israel occurs here as the end ‘bracket’ matching
verse 14. Rejoice ... glory: joy, here (cf the singing of 54:1)
symbolizes glad entrance into what the Lord has done for us; he
is the Agent, we the beneficiaries; his the work, ours the joy.
Provision for the needy (41:17-20). The righteous God who
upholds (8-13), the Redeemer who transforms (14-16), is now
the Creator who provides. He transforms his creation for the
255
ISAIAH 41:17-20
benefit of his people in their need. The details of the picture are
drawn from Exodus 13 — 17. .
17. Poor means ‘lowly’ and comes to mean ‘down-trodden’,
crushed under life’s burden (10:2). Needy has the positive
connotation of ‘willing’ (especially, willing to go God’s way) but
the negative connotation of ‘pliable’, bending before life’s more
powerful forces, resourceless (14:30). In Exodus 17, faced with
lack of water, the people grumbled; Moses prayed, and prayer,
not grumbling, was the solution to the crisis. When needs are
faced by prayer, J the LORD will answer ... not forsake.
18-19. Water (18) and shade (19) are the two great needs of
the desert traveller (Ex. 15:27). None of the trees mentioned are
fruit trees: the point is shelter, not sustenance. The trees, also, are
all Palestinian, not Mesopotamian, indicating the location of the
author. The Lord’s answer to prayer comes by innovation (rivers
on barren heights), multiplication (springs where water already
flowed in the valleys) and transformation (desert and parched
ground becoming pools and springs). Together: ‘all at once’, a
dramatic miracle of provision.
20. People: simply ‘they’, ie. the ‘needy’ of verse 17, forming, with the LORD and Jsrael, a bracket around the section. On
Lord ... Holy One, see verse 14; created, see 4:5.
b. Gentile hope (41:21 — 42:17)
The first two of the three voices of comfort in 40:3-11 had
definite universal dimensions: all mankind ... all men (40:5-6).
The passages on God the Creator and the Lord of history (40:12-
31; 41:1—7) both flowed out into assurances for Israel (40:27-31;
41:8-20). Yet the three pictures in 41:8-20 focus completely on
Israel (8), Jacob (14), the ‘exodus people’ under the care of the
God of Israel (17, 20). So what has happened to the universal
dimension? Isaiah has made his readers face the grim reality of
belonging to the world outside Israel — in particular the spiritual
plight of worshipping man-made gods (40:18-20) and the
consequent defencelessness of life on earth with none to turn to
but gods who are themselves products of human trembling (41:5—
7). But the Creator God, who cannot forget his chosen (40:27ff.), does not forget the wide reaches of his creation, and it is to this topic that Isaiah now turns, revealing how the universal aspects of the message of comfort will be met.
i. Summoned before the court: the plight of the Gentile world (41:21—29). This section falls into two parallel halves. In verse 21 the idol gods are summoned to court and, in parallel
256
ISAIAH 41:21-24
(25), the Lord testifies before the court; 22-23 state the question
which is to be tested at law: can the idols predict the future?
Apparently not! But (26-27) the Lord can! Consequently, the
Judge sums up both the uselessness of idols (24) and the plight of
their devotees (28-29). As usual in Old Testament courtroom
dramas we must accept that the Lord calls the court into session,
appears before it as one of the witnesses, and finally pronounces
the decision himself as Judge. The topic being tested at law —
ability to predict — arises from what we have already been told
about the Gentile world. In 41:2-7, in the face of the conqueror,
the world trembles and rushes to make gods to meet a challenge
which has caught them unawares. Their gods, like themselves,
are wise only after the event.
The courtroom (1): idols and idolaters challenged (41:21—
24). 21. The LORD ... Jacob’s King: this emphasis on a (merely)
national God is deliberate. The Lord comes before the court as
one God among many — because this is the point at issue: which
of all the claimants to divinity is genuine?
22-23. Bring in your idols ..., literally ‘Bring them near and
let them tell us’ (22a), is best understood (with NIV) as a command to idolaters to carry in their gods. The challenge is
expressed in general terms: predict the future (22ab)! This is then
set out in its two aspects: first, 22cde explains the ‘flow’ of
history, so that in the light of former things (what has happened
already) they might deduce what the outcome will be. Can they
foretell the future by understanding the past? Alternatively, can
they say simply what will happen next (23ab)? These abilities,
says Isaiah, would prove that you are gods. Do something: better,
‘Indeed, do anything!’ Isaiah gives them carte blanche. His contention, sensibly, is that deity will show itself in two ways: by
actions (23d) demonstrating life, and by predictions demonstrating sovereign rule over the world in all its complexity. A real
God will show himself by speaking his word and then watching
over his word to bring it to pass (Nu. 23:19; Je. 1:9, 11).
24. To catch the effect, allow a silence between verses 23 and
24. The gods who can do nothing can say nothing either (Ps.
115:4~7). So the Judge rounds on them as one whose point has
been proved. ‘Behold’ (omitted in NIV), or ‘Just look!’ Less than
nothing, ‘partakers of nonentity’; worthless, an otherwise unknown word, is possibly related to the verb ‘to gasp’, hence a
‘sigh’, something insubstantial and evanescent. Chooses you: a
deliberate contrast with verse 8. Detestable: a technical word,
‘abhorrent (to the Lord)’ (Dt. 7:25-26). People become like the
gods they choose (Ps. 115:8; Je. 2:5).
oat
ISAIAH 41:25—29
The courtroom (2): the true God in action and prediction
(41:25-29). The idol gods have been exposed as ignorant of the
future (22-23) and unable to act (23) but, by contrast, the Lord is
the Agent behind history (25) and the Predictor of what he will
do (25-27). J 25-26. Stirred: the same verb as in verse 2 with the same
meaning of ‘rousing as from sleep’, the initiation of the subsequent flow of events. The advocates of a ‘Second Isaiah’ (see
pp. 28-33) place the prophet in Babylon, living and ministering
within the period of Cyrus the conqueror. If we had only verse 26
this might be a feasible view. From the beginning could mean
that the Lord was able to do the second thing he had challenged
the idols to do: to discern the flow of events and judge their
tendency; spécifically to understand and interpret the activity of
Cyrus. But the stirred up of verse 25 claims more. The initiative
rests with the Lord; the conqueror was, so to say, asleep till the
Lord woke him up. The Lord can do the first thing he asked of
the idols: tell the future from scratch! This is the implication of
beforehand, i.e. prior to something else (Jos. 11:10; 14:15).
Hence, here, ‘from the beginning and (even) before the
beginning’. The Lord is the Originator of events. North ... rising
sun: from his Palestinian viewpoint, Isaiah describes the coming conqueror in typical terms: in his lifetime the great threats to the
western states arose from the east and invaded from the north.
But, as Isaiah develops this theme, the unnamed conqueror
becomes Cyrus (44:24 — 45:7), who did indeed originate in the
east and descended on Babylon from the north. Calls on my
name: the Hebrew (qara’ b‘sém) has four possible meanings: to
worship (Gn. 12:8), to call by name (40:26), to bring into close
relationship (43:1) and to proclaim a name (Ex. 34:5). In this
context the suitable meaning is that, since the rise and career of
the conqueror confirms the predictions, he will by his coming and
actions proclaim the Lord as the only God. He was right: used in lawcourts of the one in whose favour the verdict was pronounced.
27. Marvellously staccato Hebrew betrays Isaiah’s excitement:
literally, it reads ‘The first thing — to Zion — Watch, watch for
them — a bringer of good news —I will give!’ The ‘first thing’ is not the event but the Lord’s predictive word. Those who believe it watch for its fulfilment. To a captive people another conqueror is usually bad news, but as well as predicting coming events the Lord also tells their significance: this conqueror is good news. 28-29. Matching verse 24 with its exposure of the uselessness of the idol gods, Isaiah now turns to the plight of those who live their lives without divine revelation. No-one gives them counsel
258
4|
ISAIAH 42:1
or answers their questions. They are false, delusive, fraudulent
(32:6). Deeds best refers here to the ‘work’ of making an idol.
Where there is no veritable voice from heaven (28) nothing that
humans can do will fill that gap — except with nonentity (nothing,
see 40:17), insubstantiality (wind) and meaninglessness (confusion, tohi, 24:10; 40:17).
ii. The Servant: the great solution (42:1-9). The NIV fails to
bring out the dramatic link between 42:1 and what has preceded.
In two parallel passages (41:21-24, 25-29) Isaiah exposed the
deadness of idols. Each passage ended with a dramatic summons
(Heb. hén), ‘Look!’ or ‘Behold!’: verse 24, ‘Look at this! —
Meaningless idols!’; verse 29, ‘Look at this! — Pathetic idolaters!’
Now, for the third time, the same word rings out (42:1, hén):
“Look at this! — My Servant!’ See Introduction, pp. 26-27. The
advent of the Lord’s Servant is unexpected but not inappropriate:
he comes as the Lord’s answer to the plight of a world without
divine revelation. His ministry is justice (verses 1d, 3c, 4b): to the nations, worldwide justice (1d); in faithfulness, genuine
justice; and justice established on earth (4b), permanent justice.
We naturally think of justice as implying a fair and pure society,
and of course the word mispat — caters for this — but only
derivatively. The parallel in verse 4bc between justice and law provides us with the clue that in this passage Isaiah is using the
word to express one aspect of divinely revealed truth. Law means
‘teaching’ (1:10): mispat — to mention no other examples — occurs
nearly thirty times in Psalm 119 (7, 13, 20, efc.) and nearly
twenty times in Deuteronomy (4:1; 5:1; efc.) as one aspect of
what we would call ‘the word of God’. The verb behind the noun
(Vsapat) means ‘to give judgment’, the authoritative pronouncement of king or judge. Just as the Lord’s /aw is his teaching, so
his justice (‘judgment’) is ronounced to be true, the
decision he has reached. The Servant comes, then, as the bearer
to the nations of what they have hitherto lacked: a veritable word
from God, the answer to their needs as exposed in 41:24, 28-29.
At this point, Isaiah does not ask who the Servant is. His task, to
be the Agent of worldwide revelation, corresponds to the
worldwide role of Abraham and his ‘seed’ (Gn. 12:3; 18:18;
22:18; 26:4). Furthermore, in 41:8, ‘Israel’ has been addressed as
‘my servant’ so that, at this point, the connection must be made:
the Servant is Israel, the ‘seed’ of Abraham. We must wait to see
how Isaiah will develop this basic truth. 1. Uphold: literally ‘grip fast’. The idea is not so much of
imparting strength as of the Lord’s rights over his Servant and his
259
ISAIAH 42:2-4
determination to keep his Servant for himself. In whom I delight:
literally ‘in whom my soul delights’. ‘Soul’ here represents personal commitment, as we might say ‘delight with all my heart’.
Someone can be chosen for a task without necessarily being
approved of or even liked — as every employer knows! Not so
here! He is not ord’s man for the job, he is (like David, 1 Sa. 13:14; Acts13:22) the Lord’s man for the Lord himself. My Spirit is the Lord’s personal presence (Ps. 139:7) in action (40:7;
Ps. 33:6), endowing for leadership (Nu. 11:16ff.; 1 Sa. 16:13; cf 11:1-2; 61:1-2). As a consequence of this divine enduement, the Servant will perform the universal task of bringing divine truth (justice) to the nations, the Gentiles worldwide. ~ 2-3. The keyword justice occurs for the second time (3c), now
linked with the manner of the Servant as he brings God’s
revelation. self-assertive He is not (2): probably the three verbs
here are cumulative, stressing his quiet, unaggressive demeanour,
but shout (‘shriek’) could suggest that he is not out to startle, cry
out (‘raise his voice’) not out to dominate or shout others down,
raise his voice (‘make his voice heard’) not out to advertise
himself. He is not dismissive of others: however useless or
beyond repair (bruised reed), however ‘past it’ and near extinction (smouldering wick) they may seem. The negative statements
imply their positive equivalents: he can mend the broken reed,
fan into flame the smouldering wick. The former has been internally damaged, the latter lacks the external nourishment of oil. The
Servant is competent both to cure and to supply.
4. Falter and discouraged (‘burn low ... bruise [easily]’)
match corresponding the words in verse 3. The Servant comes right into the human situation. The things that crush and quench
he will experience, but he will triumph and succeed in ‘establishing’ justice, the revelation of God, on earth. Establishes
(Vsim): used in Deuteronomy 4:44 of Moses’ ‘setting’ the Lord’s
law before Israel. Through the Servant’s Jaw (teaching) the
privilege of the one nation becomes the possession of all. Islands:
earth’s remotest bound (see 40:15). Put their hope: when they hear, the Gentile world will stake their future (co ntly) in what he reveals.
Verses 5-9 comprise the ‘tailpiece’ to verses 14. One of the features of the key passages about the Servant — usually called ‘the Servant Songs’ (also in 49:1-6; 50:4-9; 52:13 — 53:12) — is that each is followed by a ‘tailpiece’ (49:7-13; 50:10-11; 54:1 — 55:13) confirming whatever has just been said. This particular ‘tailpiece’ first (5) confirms the universal task of the Servant by dwelling on the Lord of all creation, secondly (6-7) pledges the
260
ISAIAH 42:5—7
Lord’s aid to his Servant (cf 1), and thirdly (8-9) confirms the
Servant’s success (cf 4) by forecasting the overthrow of false
gods and affirming the ability of the Lord of history to bring about the promised new situation.
. God here is ha’él. The word ’él is God transcendent
(40:18). The addition of the definite article (ha) is for emphasis:
‘he who is indeed the true transcendent God’. LorD, as the
capital letters indicate, is ‘Yahweh’, the God who revealed
himself to Israel (Ex. 3:15). In 40:12ff., the truth of God the
Creator was turned to the exclusive comfort of Israel (40:27-31),
but the Creator of all cannot forget the ‘all’ he has created. The
saving mercies he revealed to Israel are for his whole world. The
verbs created ... stretched ... spread ... gives are in Hebrew all
participles expressing the unchanging relationship between the
Lord and his world. He, who in the beginning created, continues
in creative care and dominance; heavens and earth are
maintained in place by his constant activity; all life comes from
him. Created: see 4:5. All that comes ... breath ... life (‘spirit’)
are respectively productivity, life itself, and vitality or personal
ability. The ‘life’ of the natural world, just as much as the life of
humans, is the constantly ministered life of God. Life is not
inherent in the soil, nor is human life the product of a selfexisting evolutionary surge, but the direct gift of the Creator. It is
not held in perpetuity but is enjoyed by the faithfulness of his
continuing ‘giving’.
6-7. You is the Servant. Righteousness: both the conqueror
(41:2) and the Servant are called in pursuance of the Lord’s
righteous purposes. The same Lord rules in history and in grace.
Take ... keep ... make express purpose: ‘in order to take’, etc. The
Lord does not call (6a) and then leave the Servant to his own
devices. Included in the calling are a divine commitment to
accompany (the hand held), to keep safe (keep) and to achieve
his objectives (make). Keep (Vndasar) is to preserve, safeguard;
but the form here could derive from Vyasar, to shape, fashion:
whom the Lord calls he ‘shapes’ for the appointed task.
Covenant: the Servant is the covenant — not just that through him
people ... Gentiles are brought into a covenant relationship with
the Lord, but that in him covenant blessings are enjoyed. The
‘covenant’ is God’s free decision and promise to take and keep a
people for his own possession. It was Israel’s unique privilege —
to be drawn to the Lord in deliverance and redemption (Ex. 6:2—
7), to know and obey him as redeemer (Ex. 20:1-3). It began on a
universal scale with Noah (Gn. 6:17-18; 9:8-17); it became
specific to Abraham (Gn. 15, 17), the man entrusted with the
261
ISAIAH 42:8-9
universal blessing; it reached its normative form in Moses (Ex.
2:24; 24:7-8); and now, in the Servant, it extends once more to
the whole world. Universality is not, therefore, a violation or
adjustment of the covenant; it is its fulfilment. It brings, in the
Servant, the light of truth, the healing of disabilities (open eyes),
liberation from oppressive restrictions (free captives) and
transformation of circumstances (from ... darkness): like Eden,
with perfect people, perfect society and perfect environment
61:1). Ge These verses repeat what has been either a main theme or
a sub-theme in chapters 40 — 41: there is no God but the Lord (8)
and he is in charge of the flow of events (9). We can imagine the
Servant, faced with the task of bringing divine revelation to the Gentile world. It is a world full of ‘gods’ who, however unreal
they are, nevertheless exercise unimaginable power over human
minds and hearts. What an assurance, then, that in reality there is
only one God, jealous for his name and glory, a God as much in
control of the future as he is of the past, therefore the Guarantor
of the fulfilment of his Word. My name is the Lord’s distinct personal identity, differentiating him from idols. He does not
exist incognito among them; his g/ory, his own glorious nature, is
not for sharing. Even should they ape him, it is a coincidence: he
is not there. Furthermore, he is their foe and will not ultimately tolerate their continuance. In the sequence of Isaiah’s thought from 41:1 onwards, the former things are the events linked with
the irresistible conqueror (41:14, 25-27) and the new things are
the now-foretold work of the Servant (42:1—-4). Isaiah envisages
himself, for dramatic effect, as looking back on the one and forward to the other, so that the certain fulfilment of the one set
Sarl alae gives assurance of the prospective fulfilment of the other.
iii. Singing world, saving Lord (42:10-17). Rounding off
this section on the hopelessness and hope of the Gentile world
which began at 41:21, the ends of the earth, the islands (10), and
the Gentile towns of Kedar and Sela (11), combine in praise to
the Lord who marches against his enemies (12-13). The Lord
himself then (14-17) elaborates this cause for praise. His age- long silence is broken (14), he plans a world transformation (15), the world’s needy are cared for (16) and idolaters exposed to their proper shame (17). This lovely song fits accurately into its context. The Servant brought hope to the islands (4) and islands now rejoice (10); the Lord guaranteed that the Servant would open blind eyes (7) and their darkness becomes light (16); he
262
ISAIAH 42:10-16
promised that his glory would no longer be given to idols (8) and
the former devotees of the idols now give him praise (12). A
world’s song to a saving Lord indeed!
10-13. There is a call to sing (10-11), the subject of the song
(12), and the cause of celebration (13). The viewpoint is
universal: the wide perspective (10) of earth and islands contrasts
with the local perspective (11) of desert, Kedar in the north
(Syrian) Arabian desert and Sela in Moab; the remote ends of the
earth contrast with nearby Kedar, islands with desert, earth with
sea, and down to sea-level with mountaintops. Thus the whole
world unites in a new song (10), that is, a song (Pss. 33:3; 96:1;
98:1) responding to a new display of the goodness of God, a new
song prompted by the ‘new things’ (9) and, as always, the motif
of entering with joy into a freely given benefit (54:1). The conqueror provoked universal terror (41:1—7); the Servant prompts
universal song. The earth (islands, desert) joins its people (all
who live) in praise because creation itself has been released from
the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the children of God
(Rom. 8:19ff.). The repeated call to praise (12) introduces the
cause of all this overflowing joy (13): the triumph of the warrior
Lord. Mighty man is specifically ‘warrior’, the noun gibbor
matched by its verb triumph over (Vgabar), ‘prove himself a
warrior indeed’.
In verses 14-17 Isaiah turns abruptly from the war metaphor
of verse 13. In chapters 40 — 55 he makes no secret that the Lord
has enemies and that the day of their defeat will come, but as a
topic this belongs to chapters 56 — 66 — in exactly the same way
that the Lord Jesus terminated his quotation of 61:1, 23 (Lk.
4:17-19) without mentioning the day of vengeance, because that
belongs to his second coming, not his first.
14. The long silence comprises the whole history of the
Gentile world. That it should have been left without a word from
God is not accidental or purposeless. It was a self-imposed divine
restraint but, as with pregnancy, it was a period leading step by
step to a planned, dated and inevitable outcome. The Lord had
never forgotten the whole world in his prior engagement with the
family of Abraham. He has been gestating a great purpose, and
now it has come to birth.
15-16. It will be a time when the old order is brought to an
end: the fertility (vegetation) and water (rivers, pools) that
sustained life will disappear, but that does not mean the end of
life, only a different way of life — a life dependent on the Lord’s
care for whose whom he leads out. He caters for everything:
their personal incapacities of blindness and ignorance (16ab),
263
ISAIAH 42:17
circumstantial problems of darkness and rough terrain (16cd) —
and all with the guarantee of his personal presence and action
(lead ... guide ... turn ... not forsake). It would be totally
unsuitable to think that this refers to the return journey from
Babylonian exile. That was a way on which they needed no
guide. The Lord is in fact himself undertaking the task he earlier
(7) appeared to depute to his Servant. It is the Gentile world,
blind without divine revelation, being brought from darkness to
light, and from the power of Satan to God (Acts 26:15-18).
17. However, the theme of victory over foes cannot be forgotten, and verse 17 matches 13. The former verse merely notes
confrontation and victory; the latter offers explanations. Who are
the Lord’s enemies? Those who stubbornly hold on in faith to
false gods. In.a world of praise (10-12) it is they who will experience shame; some will be led to safety under divine care (16),
others will refuse. Shame always has the idea of ‘reaping shame’,
experiencing disappointment of hopes, suffering loss where they
reached for gain. Their ¢rust was in idols ... images — the former
carved, the latter molten: either way mere human artefacts. Ultimately their trust was in themselves and what they could do.
It was the way of works — not that simple trust in the Lord,
beautifully illustrated when the blind take a proffered hand (16).
VII. THE LORD’S PLAN UNFOLDED (42:18 — 44:23)
Isaiah has seen his people caught up in a double plight: captivity
because of sin — and that the deadliest of all sins, the
abandonment of the way of faith, the rejection of the Lord’s
promises in favour of a do-it-yourself remedy (chs. 38 — 39). But
the double plight was matched by a double cure, the word of
comfort (40:1—2): both that the time of duress would end, and
that iniquity would be pardoned. The section that now opens
continues along this twin track — and it really is a twin track: the
parallel development of two themes. Captivity will be ended by
national liberation (42:18 — 43:21), and sin dealt with by spiritual
redemption (43:22 — 44:23). Under the former heading, Isaiah
moves through four topics: captivity (42:18-25), the meeting of
this need (43:1—7), the Lord, Saviour and sole God, in contrast
with idols (43:8-13), and redemption from Babylon (43:14—21).
He then offers four matching topics: sin (43:22-24), the meeting
of this need (43:25 — 44:5), the Lord, Redeemer and only God in
contrast with idols (44:6-20), and redemption from sin (44:21— 23). It is important to grasp this overall plan. Isaiah wrote a book with planned development and everything in its proper place. As
264
ISAIAH 42:18-19
an example of this, note how, with the matching passages on
idols (43:8-13; 44:6-20), each suits its own context: the former
focuses on the inability of other ‘gods’ to act in history, the latter on their inability to save spiritually.
a. Israel’s bondage and liberation (42:18 — 43:21)
i. The blind servant (42:18—25). 18-19. In verse 18 blind
(like deaf) is plural, in verse 19 blind is singular. The plural looks
back to verses 7 and 16, where the blind are the benighted
Gentile world out of which the Lord will lead, by his Servant and
by his personal action, those whom he illuminates. Since verse 19
is about the Lord’s servant, this is plainly a topic of vital concern
to the Gentile world, for their spiritual illumination and
deliverance is at stake. But when they look, it is to see a servant
as blind as they are! This servant is the one mentioned in 41:8,
the Lord’s people, Israel: but now an Israel in ‘prisons’ (22),
consigned to ‘the plunderers’ (24); and, as if this were not disappointment enough for the blind Gentiles, an Israel under
punishment for sin (24) and without spiritual sensitivity (25).
Isaiah, then, is doing two things: first, he is ruling out the possibility that the servant nation (41:8) can be the Servant revealer
and rescuer (42:1—7). Can the blind lead the blind? Some other
Servant must emerge if the great role is to be fulfilled. But,
secondly, Isaiah is dramatically introducing the topic of this
section: how deep is Israel’s need! The heaping up of honorific
titles, servant ... messenger ... committed ... servant, underlines
the dignity of the calling of the people of God. Servant as defined
in 42:14 confers the duty of bringing divine revelation to a
bereft world; messenger (lit. ‘my messenger whom I send’)
speaks of a commission given to one on whom the Lord has a
personal claim (‘my’); committed comes from \salem, ‘to be at
peace, enjoy wholeness/well-being’. The form of passive participle found here means ‘brought into peace, reconciled’, ie.
enjoying the benefits and blessings of salvation. But Israel, sadly,
is deaf to his word and blind, or spiritually untransformed. This
latter thought is the one Isaiah hammers out, blind ... blind ...
blind,' underlying the need for the work of transforming grace
which it is the servant’s task to bring to the world.
1 The double use of blind in vv. 19cd where parallelism would expect deaf in
the final line has provoked adverse comment. Whybray (/saiah 40 — 66) calls it
‘extremely ugly’. But in Heb. poetry parallelism is a tool, not a bondage. It is the
genius of Heb. poetry to make ‘form’ flexible to meaning, and the unexpected
blind is exactly the right emphasis in context.
265
ISAIAH 42:20-25
20. The blindness and deafness of the Israel-servant is now
carefully diagnosed. It is not the total darkness of the Gentile
world (41:7, 16). The Lord’s Israel has sight, you have seen many
things, an abundant revelation of divine truth has been granted;
spiritual deafness has been remedied, your ears are open. The
problem with the Lord’s people (then and now) is not that the
basic work of transformation is yet to be done, but that, transformation having taken place, no attention has been paid, the
open ears hear nothing. The word of God is available but
ignored. ’ 21. The verse speaks of something that delights the Lord
(pleased, as in 53:10), of something that expresses his righteous
nature and fulfils his righteous purpose (righteousness) — his law
or ‘teaching’, the truth of God imparted by revelation to his
people — and of the purpose he envisaged in giving his Jaw,
literally ‘that he should make the law great and mighty/
splendid’. The ‘he’ in question may be the Lord himself: he gave
his teaching to his people, purposing through their obedience that
divine truth should be seen in its greatness and splendour.
Alternatively the ‘he’ may be Israel: that they should set out, by
faithful adherence to Scripture in conviction and practice, to
display the wonders of divine truth to the world (cf Dt. 4:5—7; Tit. 2:10).
22. But, far from winning the world, the world conquered
Israel (cf. 2:5—9)! Through failure to ‘make the law great’, Israel
lost its distinctive status in the world (22:a—c) and its protected
status before the Lord (22d—g) — the truth taught in the Song of
the Vineyard: no fruit-bearing, no protection (5:1—7). Pits ...
prisons: no prophet living with exiled Israel in Babylon could so
describe the exile. Conditions were not quite as bad as that (Je.
29). Isaiah is using conventional stereotypes of captivity to
underscore the enormity of Israel’s downfall from the divine
intention.
23-25. Recognizing that he has an unpalatable truth to share
(Which of you will listen?), Isaiah takes us to the theological
heart of Israel’s situation. First, the key question to ask is not
‘Why?’ but ‘Who?’ ‘Why?’ is the cry of logic looking for a way
to make life’s tragedies fit into a humanly satisfying pattern. To this there is no answer (55:8). ‘Who?’ brings us to rest on the executive sovereignty of the Lord. Was it not the LORD? Sec- ondly, for the people of God the word of God is the clue to life: the tragedy came about through sin. They would not follow ... did not obey: i.e. specifically the sin of having revealed truth but not conforming to it. Would not follow: (lit.) ‘were not willing to
266
ISAIAH 43:1-2
walk in’, Ze. an unsubmitted will. Obey: ‘listen to’, the submission of the mind to the word of God. Thirdly, there is the reality
of divine chastisement: his personal burning anger. On anger, cf.
5:25. Violence of war: the Lord of history uses the forces of
history to punish his disobedient people. Fourthly, disobedience
brings suffering and loss, flames ... consumed. But, fifthly, not
even suffering on the scale of defeat, bondage and deprivation
(22) produced reformation: as Isaiah viewed his people he saw in
them spiritual incomprehension, they did not understand ... take
it to heart. The Lord’s people though they are, possessing his
truth though they do, they are still direly in need of an inner work
of transformation, first touching the mind (understand, lit.
‘know’), and then the heart, the inner spring of responsiveness
and direction (Pr. 4:23).
ii. Unchanged divine care (43:1—7). With great drama, Isaiah
moves from the Lord’s people in the Lord’s fire (42:25) to the
Lord who will not allow the fire to burn them (43:2).
1. But now makes a logical connection with what has gone
before: ‘Now then’. Israel has been revealed as blind (42:19),
inattentive (42:20), falling short of the Lord’s plan (42:21),
defeated (42:2), sinfully disobedient (42:24), spiritually uncomprehending and insensitive (42:25). ‘Now then’ is enough to
make us quake in our shoes! How will the Lord react to such a
catalogue of culpability? Created... formed: the verbs are used in
their established sense, the former to bring into being, de novo,
by a sole and free act of God, and the latter to fashion and mould
into shape as a potter would. So the Lord determined to have a people for his very own, brought them into being and shaped
them_on the wheel of circu is is the fir ound on which the Lord will say, you are mine (Eph. 1:4; 2:10). The
seogny ground is redemption. The verb is Vga’al (35:10). The
ord made himself the Next-of-Kin of the people he had created.
They are his family and he shoulders all their needs as if his own. The third ground is relationship the personal between the Lord
and his people (summoned by name) whereby, as we might say,
they are on first-name terms. 2. The Lord will not now desert his people. They may have
given up on him (42:18-25), but not he on them! Many see the
hardships mentioned here as those of the exiles returning from
captivity, but such extreme hardships rather suggest those of
captives being dragged off by their captors (cf 47:2). When
Isaiah speaks of homecoming, he does so in terms of a new exodus journey, with miraculous provisions and supplies (48:20-21).
267
ISAIAH 42:3-7
3-4. The safety they enjoy under and within such lifethreatening experiences (2) is explained (For) in five ways. (a)
By the Lord’s name, LORD, Yahweh, the everlasting statement of
his character (Ex. 3:15). Yahweh is the God defined in the exodus
revelation as the One who delivers and redeems his people (Ex.
6:6—7) and overthrows his foes (Ex. 12:12). Unless he changes
his name (alters his character), he is committed to his Israel. (b)
By the relationship between himself and his people: notwithstanding all their failings (42:18-25), he still calls himself
your God. (c) By his holiness: the great Isaianic title, the Holy
One of Israel (1:4), holds together the reality of his holiness and ity_of his relationship with Israel. If his holiness and their
sinfulness did not militate against forming the relationship, then
it cannot militate against its continuance. (d) By his saving
ability: while the verb Vyasa‘ expresses salvation from sin (64:5),
it majors on deliverance from afflictions (1 Sa. 9:16; 2 Sa. 22:4),
suitably to this context. (e) By the evidence of the past: NIV
follows many in the translation J will give, and, of course, the
Hebrew perfect tense can well express a confidence for the future
(‘I have determined to give’), but this is understandable only if
we take it to mean ‘I have determined to give (if I have to)’, for
Egypt has no part to play in the Lord’s future care of his people.
Furthermore, to translate the perfect here as a future destroys the
contrast with J will give at the end of the verse. Rather, the titles
of the Lord in verse 3ab flow naturally into a reference back to
the exodus: because he is Yahweh, Israel’s God and Holy One,
their Saviour, he actually did give Egypt as their ransom. Faced
with Egyptian intransigent refusal to let the people go, the Lord,
so to speak, weighed up whether he was prepared to shatter
Egypt in order to free Israel. There was ‘no contest’, and it was
‘at the expense of” (ransom, koper, the price paid; see 6:7) Egypt
that Israel was freed. Cush and Seba are respectively the extreme
south of Egypt and lands still further south. They are a poetical
elaboration of the picture of the price paid. Jn your stead
expresses one taking the place of another (Gn. 22;13; 1 Ki.
11:43). Israel was under sentence of death (Ex. 1:16, 22), but
Egypt ‘died’ (Ex. 14:27, 31) instead. This past flows into the present, in which the Lord treasures his people (precious) and has not withdrawn their honoured position as his people. Consequently, for the future, not even humankind (men) itself nor all people (‘peoples’) would be too high a price. _ 5-7. 1 will bring: the wide reference to ‘humankind’ in verse 4 is now justified. The Lord foresees a worldwide scattering and a worldwide regathering. From all the compass points (5-6),
268
ISAIAH 43:8-9
embracing everyone of his people (7). My sons ... daughters:
right up to the End the Next-of-Kin relationship (1; Ex. 2:21)
remains unchanged, and the initial thoughts of created and
formed are enhanced by the added thought that, in so doing, the Lord purposed hi own glory. Thus his honour is bound up with
the final security of those whom he chose to be his people.
iii. No other God: sure promises (43:8—-13). Whether we
think of Isaiah’s people as in Palestine or taken into exile or
residents in Babylon, they are surrounded by other gods and their
devotees. Therefore they need to get their theology straight: what
sort of entities are these who seem so powerful and whom others
worship with such conviction? This short passage, therefore, has
an abiding relevance. Notice how it climaxes on a claim by the
Lord to be the only saviour (11). This not only links it with
verses 1—7 (see 3), but it turns the discussion to the practical
question of who can effectively deliver in the thick of the world’s
adversities. In form, the passage is another courtroom drama (cf.
41:21-—29). The court assembles (8—9b), the issue is stated (9c-f),
the Lord’s witnesses are presented (10a-d) and his claim is
affirmed (10e—11), the issue is settled (12), and the verdict given
(13). The point of this quasi-legal presentation is that what Isaiah
asserts about the Lord (11-12) is not a fable but a truth tested at
law, a verified conclusion based on evidence.
8-9. We must not miss the pathos: imagine any litigant
depending on the blind to testify to what they have seen and the
deaf to what they have heard! The Lord’s people could have been
very different: theirs is a culpable deficiency, for they have eyes
and ears; they were granted faculties of spiritual perception but
chose to be blind and deaf, refusing to see and hear (6:9-10;
29:9; 42:20, 24) — and the Lord’s case depends on their
testimony! Which of them: the voice is that of the Presiding
Judge. This ... the former things: the interpretation of this turns
on how we understand verse 3. We noted that many make verses
3-7 refer to the future (see p. 268). If so, then his could be the
fact of the coming conqueror (41:1-4, 25) as in that earlier court
scene, and former (lit. ‘first’) things would be an open request to the idols to mention any earlier prediction they may have made.
If (as we hold) verse 3 refers back to the exodus, then this and
fermer both look back to that first great act of the Lord for Israel.
Do the ‘gods’ have any such thing to their credit (cf Dt. 4:34-37;
2 Sa. 7:22-24)? Right: i.e. in the right, gaining the verdict. The
case must go to the one who can demonstrate by credible evidence his sovereign capacity to determine beforehand what he
269
ISAIAH 42:10-13
is going to do, and then do it without alteration, let or hindrance.
This is the mark of deity. ;
10-11. The pathos continues. You are my witnesses — as if the
Lord has to prompt his witnesses to testify on his behalf! How
well Isaiah knows our guilty silences! Declares, see 1 24;
servant, as in 41:8 (see 42:1). The ‘servant people’ inherit the
Abrahamic vocation to the ~world, but their privileged
conscription to be the Lord’s (chosen) was intended (so that) to
bring them to spiritual conviction (know ... understand, lit. ‘discern, see to the heart of’) and to faith. Believe me: the
construction ha’“min 1° mostly means to believe what someone
says (Gn. 45:26) but it also includes trusting (Dt. 9:23). J am he is
the answer to the question Which? in verse 9. Before me ...: the
attempt to prod the witnesses into action has failed, and the Lord
speaks in his own cause about his uniqueness (10ef) and his work
(11). Formed: the gods of the pagan world were often spoken of
as coming into being, but the Lord is derived from none (before
me) and succeeded by none (after me). Unique in his being, he is
also unique in action (no saviour). Only he can enter into the
circumstances of his people (Ex. 3:8) and ‘save’ them out of all
their afflictions (Ex. 14:18, 30; 15:2; Dt. 33:29).
12-13. Thus the issue is settled (12) and the verdict
pronounced (13). Revealed (‘declared’) is the verb translated
‘proclaimed’ in verse 9. It was only the Lord who thus
proclaimed what he would do, not the idols. The sequence of the
three verbs revealed (‘declared’) ... saved ... proclaimed (‘made
[people] hear’) is important. Moses and his people were not left
to look back on the exodus, surmise that it was an act of God, and
fumble about to discern its meaning. Revelation comes first (Ex.
3 — 4) in clear divine speech: the actual words of God
anticipating the acts of God; then the events confirm the words;
and finally there is the ministry of Moses, spelling out what the
Lord has done and what it means. You are my witnesses: again the
prompting to witness, but yet again (13) the Lord must take the
task on himself. In keeping with the court scene, this last divine statement takes the form of the verdict. The Lord alone is God. From ancient days (miyyém) can mean ‘since time began’ or ‘today’ or ‘from today on’ — a comprehensive claim to a deity which pervades all time. No-one can deliver: this is no remote or ornamental deity but a sovereign over every other possible agency, human or ‘divine’. The Lord is the God who has absolute rights over all people and, as who can reverse ...? adds, over the whole course of events as he determines they shall happen.
270
ISAIAH 43:14-21
iv. A new exodus: the problem of bondage solved (43:14—
21). This passage concludes the section which began at 42:18: the
problem of national enslavement and the Lord’s promise to solve
it. The sequence is coherent: the problem (42:18—25), the Lord’s
unchanged care of his people (43:1—7), his sovereign ability to
save (43:8-13) and, finally, the deliverance he will effect. The
exodus which has been alluded to throughout (43:3, 9, 11) now
dominates the imagery (16-17, 19-20): what the Lord has done is the model for his coming acts.
14-15. Redeemer: go’él (see 1). Babylon: this, the first
reference to Babylon in chapters 40 — 48, picks up the Babylon
reference in 39:6: they will be going to Babylon and the Lord
will send to Babylon. The ‘Chaldeans’ (NIV mg.) were a wellknown component in the population of Babylon and appear here
as a poetical variant for Babylon. Ships: Babylon is not generally linked with shipping but Jeremiah (51:13, 26) notes it as
well watered. It is easy to think of the city delighting in its seaborne trade and now to envisage the same shipping laden with
refugees. This did not happen when Babylon fell (see on ch. 47).
Once more (see on 42:22) Isaiah is not describing but using
stereotypical images of the fall of a city. A prophet present at
the event would not have spoken thus. Holy One ... Holy One:
such emphasis on the holiness of Israel’s God is unexpected.
Maybe Isaiah is laying down a marker for the future by
reminding Israel that political liberation is not the whole story;
there remains the deeper problem of how to be right with a holy
God. Creator: see on verse 1. King adds a more personal
dimension to the relationship, for the king was father and
shepherd of his people (9:6; Ps. 78:71).
16-21. Isaiah derives his pictures from the Red Sea event (16—
17; Ex. 14) and from the wonders of that earlier wilderness
journey (19c—20; Ex. 15 — 17), but he issues an important
reminder: the past can teach and illustrate but it must not bind
(18-19b). The Lord always has greater things in store; he is
revealed in the past, but he is always more than the past revealed.
Made ... drew: the verbs are participles in the Hebrew. What the
Lord did then remains a changeless aspect of what he is:
undeterred by opposing circumstances (16) or hostile people (17).
Former things (18), i.e. the exodus, as in verse 9; new thing, i.e.
the deliverance from Babylon, patterned on the exodus. My
people, my chosen (20): ‘people’ is the relationship sealed at the
exodus (Ex. 6:7); ‘chosen’ is the divine will behind and
implementing it. Formed: the motif of the potter means that we
can face with confidence the troubles of life — even when, as
271
ISAIAH 43:22—24
here, we are the causes of our own misfortune by disobedience.
The pressures of life are loving touches of the Craftsman’s hand
as he perfects what he has planned.
b. Israel’s sin and redemption (43:22 — 44:23)
See p. 264 above for an outline of the whole section 42:18 —
44:23 and for the place and content of this present part. The verb
‘to redeem’ and the title ‘Redeemer’ link the coming passages
with the preceding (see 43:1, 14; and 44:6). The fundamental
idea is that of the Next-of-Kin who has the right to come
alongside his relative and take upon himself the debt, trouble or
burden of the other, whatever it may be. It is for this reason that
rescuing the exiles from Babylon (43:14) and rescuing sinners
from sin (44:21—22) can both be called redemption. It is to the
latter topic that Isaiah now turns.
i. Diagnosis (43:22—24). The charge apparently levelled here
of failure to engage in the ritual of the sacrifices (23ab, 24ab)
raises a difficulty because there is no known time in Israel’s
history when it would be justified. Before the exile, the complaint
of the Lord through his prophets was of inordinate and overpunctilious ritual activity (1:10-15; Je. 7:21; Am. 4:4—5; 5:21-
23; Mi. 6:6—7). During the exile, far from the Lord’s house,
sacrifice was not possible and they could hardly be blamed for
failing to do what was not open to them. After the exile, their first
communal act was to restore the sacrifices (Ezr. 3:3), and Haggai
(2:10-14) and Malachi (1:7) both imply continuing sacrificial
worship. The meaning of the present verses, therefore, must lie
beneath rather than on the surface.
First, then, the emphasis in the Hebrew of verse 22a requires
“Not upon me did you call ...’, an accusation matching 1:10ff.,
not that ritual and prayer had ceased but that they failed to reach
the God to whom they were supposedly addressed. This emphasis
appears only in the wording of 22a, but if we allow it to set the
aa throughout, the passage makes sense. Their religion was a ailure.
Secondly, there is the verb burdened (23c, 24c), literally ‘I did not make slaves of you with grain offerings ... you made a slave of me with your sins.’ By the exodus the Lord brought his people out of slavery (Ex. 6:6) and gave them his law, both moral and cultic, as a sign that they were no longer slaves (Ex. 20:2, 3ff.) but could walk at liberty (Ps. 119:45). As we saw in 1:10-15, however, they had brought themselves into a new bondage, a religion of incessant observance. But ritual for its own sake,
272
ISAIAH 43:22-24
observance divorced from moral and spiritual commitment,
neither satisfies God (1:11, 13) nor brings blessing to people
(1:15). Indeed, to the contrary, for they had made ritual a technique for manipulating blessing, putting the Lord at their beck
and call. Thus, enslaving themselves all over again, they sought also to make him their slave!
Thirdly, the verb wearied runs through these verses (22b, 23d,
24d). Verse 22b is (lit.) ‘you have wearied of me’.' In verses 23-
24 the causative active means, ‘I did not make you weary ... you
made me weary.’ The sacrificial system was meant by the Lord to
be part of the joy of possessing his law: through the sacrifices
atonement was made, sins were forgiven and fellowship with
God was enjoyed (Lv. 1:4; 4:31; Dt. 16:10-11). But when the
sacrifices were allowed to become an end in themselves, the
people remained in their sin and became a weariness upon the
Holy One. Seen along these lines, verses 22-24 join the other
passages of pre-exilic rebuke at misuse of the sacrificial system.
There was much religious fervour, no religious reality; where
they assumed they were pleasing God, they were trying his
patience; where they were most confident they were right with
God, they were proving only that they were still in their sin. In
this searching way Isaiah establishes Israel’s sin and need for
divine forgiveness.
22. Called upon: Genesis 13:4 shows that this expression
includes the cultic side of religion, but it cannot but emphasize
the personal side of prayer and communion with God. Upon me:
again, emphatic. Their religion left God out, so far was it from
the divine intention (1:15; Am. 5:21—23; Mt. 15:9).
23-24. The pronouns me ... me here need emphasis to convey
the correct interpretation. Honoured ... sacrifices: Malachi 1:6—7
says that the Lord is dishonoured by religion on the cheap; the
dishonour here is done rather by mechanical religion, the assumption that the rite is instrumentally or medicinally effective.
The moral majesty of the Lord is dishonoured by subjecting him
to a form of magic. Burdened ... wearied: see opposite and
above. Incense (Ex. 30:34ff.; Lv. 2:2): indicative of the Lord’s
delight in the sacrifices when used according to his will.
Calamus: see Exodus 30:23; Jeremiah 6:20. Lavished: literally
‘saturated me’, i.e. given me superabundant satisfaction. This is
central to true religion — not that we should ‘find it helpful’, but
1 The verb is Vydga‘ with the preposition b° following. This means ‘to work
for’, i.e. so as to gain (62:8), ‘to be involved with, taken up with’ (47:12), ‘to be
weary of’ (57:10).
273
ISAIAH 43:25-28
that God should find it delightful. ‘True religion must be conformed to the will of God as its unerring standard.” Sins
(hatta’ t), and offences (‘Gwon), see 6:7.
ii. Remedy (43:25 — 44:5). No sooner is the need diagnosed
than the remedy is prescribed. Compare the same alacrity of
mercy when 40:12 follows 39 or when 43:3—7 follows 42:18—
25! The God burdened and wearied by sins is the God who blots
them out (25) and brings refreshing (44:3). 25. Note that there is no connecting word between this verse
and 22-24. There is no logic whereby we might connect sin with
forgiveness, nor does the Lord explain himself. The logic
whereby the offended God is the forgiving God is hidden in his
heart. The emphasis J, even I catches at this truth — as though to
say, ‘You would not know what to do about this (22-24), you
have no remedy — but I am myself all you need.’ Blots out: “wipes
clean’ (2 Ki. 21:13; Ps. 51:1). Sin leaves a mark which only the
Lord can wipe away. The verbal form here is a participle, making
this ability to wipe sin’s stain clean a divine attribute.
Transgressions: ‘deliberate rebellions’ (24:20). Remembers ... no
more (Je. 31:34; Mi. 7:18-19): the Lord’s inability to remember
anything against us. Sins, as in verse 24.
26-28. The simplest way to understand these verses is as a
brief court scene in which the accused is given the opportunity to
establish innocence (26), the prosecution case is stated (27) and
divine judgment justified (28).
Argue the matter (26) is, specifically, ‘to argue a case at law’.
Whether in forgiveness or in condemnation, the Lord will proceed only on the basis of justice. In this case, before adverse
sentence is noted, the accused must be confronted by the hopelessness of their case and the rightness of sentence. First father:
this tracing of sin back to remote forebears is not a departure
from the accusation levelled at the present generation in verse 26.
In biblical thought, each generation takes over from the last in a
cumulative guilt, and each new generation ‘fills up’ the measure
of its predecessors (Mt. 23:31-32, 35-36). The first father in this tragic moral entail could be Adam (the father par excellence), Abraham (the ultimate ancestor, 41:8), Jacob (the immediate father of the twelve-tribe nation) or Aaron (the founder of the priestly order; note how priests may be the topic in 28a).
! J. Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion (SCM, 1960), 1.iv.3. 21 owe this suggestion to H. Blocher, Original Sin, New Studies in Biblical Theology (Apollos, 1997), p. 31.
274
ISAIAH 44:1-2
Identification is immaterial: the point is the weight of demonstrable guilt in which the current generation participates.
Spokesmen: the verb Viis is best known in the Bible by the noun
formed from it, Jes, ‘a scorner, scoffer, cynic’ (Ps. 1:1); the
participle found here does bear this meaning (Jb. 16:20), but is
also used as ‘interpreter’ (Gn. 42:23) and ‘envoy’ (2 Ch. 32:31).
The idea here may be ‘representative’, even ‘your typical ones’,
those who best typify the present generation. This would give a
suitable transition from the past (27a) to the present (28b).
Disgrace (28): the tense cannot be determined with certainty.
It could be past (‘disgraced’), incipient (‘began to disgrace’),
determinative (‘determined to disgrace’) or future (‘will disgrace’). Unless the text is emended to fix one of these meanings,
we are better to assume that the ambiguity is intentional: at every
point from the earliest days there was sin and guilt; at any
moment divine judgment would have been and is justified; the
mind of God is made up: sin must meet its reward. Dignitaries of
your temple: literally ‘princes of holiness’. ‘Holiness’ often needs
the translation ‘sanctuary’, and the ‘princes of the sanctuary’
would be the priests (1 Ch. 24:5). Alternatively, ‘princes of holiness’ more naturally means ‘holy princes’, those who were set
over the Lord’s ‘holy’ people. If the reference is to priests, then
those who were raised up to nourish the Lord’s people in holiness
were themselves signally guilty; the reference to princes (though
the description is unexemplified) fits in the back reference to
(fore)fathers. Kings were fathers to their people and, just as
earlier and actual fathers sinned and saddled their family with
guilt, so those with an office of fatherly care were themselves
fatally compromised. And I will consign: or ‘so I had to consign’.
Destruction (hérem) is not ‘destruction’ pure and simple but the
utter ‘separation’ from the face of the earth of that which the Lord
abhors (Jos. 6:17; 8:26). What a verdict! — not pardon (26) but
the divine curse (28). 44:1. But now: see 43:1. What is the logical consequence of
the accusation of age-old and contemporary sin and rebellion in
43:26-28? How does the decision at law reflect on 43:25 with its
promise of a full (blots out) and final (remembers ... no more) dealing with sin? Was the wonder of 43:25 put first in order that
we might know what we have lost by sin? No, for now in 44:2-5
a parallel promise is given: not the negative “blot out’ but the
matching positive, the gift of new life — and to the same people,
for note how the ‘Jacob ... Israel’ of 43:28 is repeated in 44:1.
The Lord never deserts his mercy towards us.
2. Made ... womb: just as 43:26-28 traced the fact of
275
ISAIAH 44:3-5
sinfulness back to the first father, so now Isaiah traces the entail
of divine creative oversight back to the womb. Divine paternity
antedated sin and is not knocked off course (will help) by our sin.
Hence the status of the Lord’s people, servant ... chosen (1-2),
remains unchanged. The gifts and calling of God are irreversible
(Rom. 11:29). Afraid: the fear in question is not that of life’s
adversities but of the consequences of sin; not fear before people
but fear before God. The promise to ‘blot out’ and ‘forget’ stands;
cancelled sin leaves no room for fear (Lk. 5:8—10; 1 Jn. 4:17-18).
Jeshurun: see Deuteronomy 32:15; 33:5, 26. The ending ‘-un’ is a diminutive of affection. The name may be related to yasar, ‘upright’. This is what the Lord wished his people to be. Used
here, it emphasizes that, though they have failed to match his
ideal, this is still his will for them. 3-5. The ground of fearlessness is now positive: the gift of my
Spirit, the Agent of ongoing blessing (offspring ... descendants),
the vitality of new life (4), personal assurance of fellowship with
the Lord among his people (5). In verse 3 new life is imparted; in
4-5 new life is displayed. On the Lord’s Spirit, see 11:2; 30:1;
31:3; 40:7; 42:1. On the ‘outpoured’ Spirit, see 32:15. The
parallel between Spirit and blessing indicates that it is by
imparting himself that the Lord brings new life to his people. In
verse 5, the renewing activity of the Lord’s Spirit becomes evident in individual response and the creation of a people bound
together by a common confession. Twice over Isaiah makes
turning to the Lord (Sac) inseparable from turning to the Lord’s
people (Sbd). The reference here is not to Gentiles coming into
membership of the Israel of God (Gal. 6:16) — that would be
totally against the context (contrast 45:22—25) — but to ‘formal’
Israelites becoming ‘true, assured’ Israelites. Three things combine to bring this about: sin finished (43:25), new life imparted
(44:34) and personal response (45:5). Hand: the organ of personal action. To write on his hand symbolizes the commitment of
personal, active life to the Lord (cf Dt. 6:8). If we translate ‘with
his hand’ the meaning is the same: personal commitment.
iii. No other God: sure promises (44:6-20). See 43:8-13. The purpose of this section is announced in verses 6-8: since there is only one God, nothing can stand in the way of his purposes. This truth is then underlined by an exposure of the whole idea of other or alternative ‘gods’ (9-20). In 40:18-20 and 41:5—7, idol gods were exposed by contrast with the glory of the God of Israel; in 43:8—13 and the present passage the argument is reversed: the glory of the God of Israel is seen by contrast with
276
ISAIAH 44:6-8
the absurdity and uselessness of the idols. The present passage
has its own central focus. It is not just the nonsense that, had
things turned out differently, what the idolater worships would
have been used to cook his lunch (15-17), but that what he
worships has no power of spiritual transformation, only the
reverse (18-20) — unlike the true God (43:25; 44:3—5)! Isaiah has
not forgotten the test of prediction and fulfilment (7), but he
adds another: what consequences follow from worship? Transformation (44:3-5) or degeneration (18-20)?
Verses 6-8 begin and end on the note of the only God (6cd,
8cd), and this brackets his uniqueness (7). All this truth about
God is related to his people’s good: the only God is the King,
etc., of Israel (6) and their Rock (8), the One in charge of the
whole course of their history, past and future (7). In all this he is
unhindered by any challenger.
6. King ... Redeemer, see 43:14-15; Almighty (‘Lord of
hosts’), see 1:24. This title occurs here for the first time in
chapters 38 — 55 (45:13; 47:4; 48:2; 51:15; 54:5). Unlike the
idols, possessing only whatever their makers impart to them (9-
17), the Lord is, within himself, every potentiality and power.
First ... last: not, as 41:1, ‘with the last’ with the thought of
purposive direction of history. As first he does not derive his
being from any other, but is self-existing; as Jast he remains
supreme at the End. God is the common plural word ‘“/ohim, but
since its singular form occurs in verse 8 maybe the plural should
be taken here as a plural of amplitude, ‘God in the fullness of the
divine attributes’.
7. What makes him incomparable? (a) He alone understands
the totality of history from the beginning. Proclaim: \qara’. In
40:26 ‘calls’ is his executive control of each item in the physical
universe, and in 41:4 ‘calling’ is his direction of the events of
history. Lay out: V‘ara', to master all the details (Ex. 40:4), draw
up a (battle) plan (1 Sa. 17:8-9), i.e. to get everything in its right
place. The Lord alone masters and orders the complexity of
history. (b) In particular, since I established demonstrates his
presiding care of his people from the start. (c) Yet to come shows
his predictive ability, the proof that it is he who purposes and
then directs everything to the fulfilment of his purpose.
8. The point of this argument (7) is not so much the exposure
of false gods as the demonstration of the glory of the true God
and therefore the security of his people. They can be without fear
(8a) on the basis of revealed truth (8b) and can attest it (8c). God:
the singular ‘““/éah, the only time it is used in Isaiah. The
intention must be to stress the singleness of this one and only
PATS
ISAIAH 44:9
God (as compared with the multiplicity of the claimants implied
in 7). Rock: a symbol of refuge (Ps. 71:3), trustworthy changelessness (26:4), ‘solid’ reality (Dt. 32:31), the God who gives life
to his people (Ex. 17:6 with Ps. 95:1). ,
In verses 9-20, the message of 6-8, that there is one
incomparable God, is justified by a searching examination of
idolatry. Verse 9 sets out a basic proposition: that idolatry makes
no sense (9a), brings no profit (9b) and can be commended only
on the basis of blind ignorance (9cd). With this latter point verses
18-20 form an inclusio: idolaters are ignorant and blind (18); idolatry is logically indefensible (19); but at a deeper level this
dead, meaningless, profitless thing grips the idolater in a hold he
cannot break (20). Between these brackets, the argument has two
main thrusts: the idol cannot rise above its human origin (10-13)
nor above its material basis (14-17). Isaiah both acknowledges
and refuses to acknowledge any invisible spiritual reality of
which the idol is the outward symbol. On the one hand there is
nothing in idolatry but the artefact: ‘The heathen in his blindness
bows down to wood and stone’ — or, as the Roman poet Horace
put it, ‘Once I used to be an oak tree ... A craftsman, however,
preferred I should be a god.’ Paul would concur: ‘We know that
an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no God but
one’ (1 Cor. 8:4). For the apostle, as for the prophet, an unambiguous monotheism determined the question. There is
nothing behind the visible idol because there is only one God. But, on the other hand, the idol holds the idolater in an iron grip
from which (20) he cannot save himself (lit. ‘deliver his soul’);
and to this Paul also would assent, in the same passage, that
‘indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”’ (1 Cor. 8:5),
and, at the deepest, most awful level, that ‘the sacrifices of
pagans are offered to demons, not to God’ (1 Cor. 10:20). The meaningless and dead idol has a grim power to make its devotees
like itself (Ps. 115:8).
9. The verse starts with the idol-maker (9a), moves to the idol
(9b) and thence to the idolater (9cd). Nothing (tohii): see 24:10;
29:21; 34:11; 40:17, 23; 41:29; ‘meaningless’, ‘making no
sense’, would be a good translation here. In verses 10-17, the description of the idol factory exposes the two inadequacies of idols. First (10-13), the idol is the product of mere humans (10-11), therefore of diminishing human energy which itself needs to be sustained from outside (12), and of human skill (13a—d) and design which cannot rise above the best it knows (13e). Secondly, the idol, in itself, is a product of earth (14) and of chance (15-17). These two inadequacies are seen
278
ISAIAH 44:10-17
most clearly in the idolatry of which Isaiah speaks — physical
objects of worship — but, equally truly, in the idols of which John
speaks (1 Jn. 5:21): whatever captures the human mind and heart
as an alternative to Jesus and the way of faith, ie. the subtler
idols of ‘market forces’, shrewd management of the economy
(and all such aspects of modern Baalism), or security through
militarism, the reckoning of national prestige in terms of force.
10-11. God ... idol: the idolater plans the spiritual and
achieves the material! He and his kind ... but men: collective
enterprise makes no difference. No matter how many craftsmen
are involved, they cannot break out of the restriction that they are
merely human. Stand ... terror ... infamy: they are not guiltless in
their idol-making. They know better. If only they would stand,
that is, stop and take a candid look at what they are doing — they
would all at once become afraid (terror), and ‘ashamed’ (as in 9),
or ‘realize what fools they have been’ (infamy). Fear and folly
would together come over them. They are culpably living below
their true dignity.
12-13. Might of his arm ... water ... faint: the exposure of
faulty thinking goes on — not only the folly (11) that the human
can create the divine, but also that human strength can create the
almighty, and that strength needing outside nourishment can
produce the self-existent, self-perpetuating life of God. The
prophet then turns from the workshop to the drawing-board, the
conceptual side of idol-making. The end-product may be
awesomely impressive in beauty or terrifyingly horrific. Either
way it is only the product of a carefully drawn blueprint and a
competent designer. Form of man ... man in all his glory (13ef):
yet, of course, it is not always so. Sometimes it is astral or brutish
in form, sometimes a hybrid of human and animal, sometimes
gross, revolting. But taking the designer at his best, he intuits that
the human is the highest he knows and designs accordingly.
Glory is ‘beauty’. Dwell in a shrine (lit. ‘a house’): it has been
made humanlike so it must do the human thing! How Isaiah
hammers away at its humanness! No matter what their intent, the
result of human effort cannot rise above the human.
14-17 introduce another devastatingly ironic aspect of this
humanness: choice and chance. The full-grown tree, cedar ...
cypress ... oak, is a hugely impressive thing, but trace it to its
origin and what do we find? A seed or cutting, a tiny thing, planted in the ground, nourished by the rain. Its ancestry is
earthly, its cultivation human, its life derived from the creation —
and its ‘deity’ is the chance which allowed it to survive the needs
of the kitchen fire! And the idolater’s ‘logic’ suggests that what
PS
ISAIAH 44:18-20
has given him the physical benefit of cooked food (roasts, 16)
and the comfort of bodily warmth (fire) can also nourish his soul:
‘Save me, you are my god’ (17).
18. Know ... understand (lit. ‘have knowledge ... see to the
heart of the matter’): see 29:14. Plastered over: who has done the
‘plastering’? There is an implied external agent creating
blindness. The justice of God visits people with what they
choose, and this could be his judicial visitation of blindness (6:9;
2 Thes. 2:10-11); or is Isaiah implying that, dead though the idol
is, it has the power to blind the minds of the unbelieving (2 Cor.
4:4)? Cannot understand (NSakal) means in general to act with
the prudence that achieves success (Jos. 1:8); here, the ability to
appraise the situation, to sift truth from error (and then act
accordingly). 19. Stops to think ... knowledge ... understanding: this is a
devastating analysis of the fallen mind. First, as to the processes
of thought: stops to think (lit. ‘takes to heart’), the ability to size
up the plain facts; secondly, the content of knowledge: truth as
held and entertained in mind and memory; and, thirdly,
understanding: discernment to sift and probe, to arrive at truth.
All this fallenness of the mind is illustrated by detestable thing ...
block of wood. In respect of a doctrine of God, intuition should
tell people that to give divine honours to a man-made thing is
‘abominable’ (cf Acts 17:29); in respect of the doctrine of
humankind, intuition should tell people that to prostrate the
human before the material cannot be right. The fallen mind
‘cannot understand’ (1 Cor. 2:14).
20. The idolater is ‘hooked’ on idolatry. A whole area of freedom has died and he is not able to save himself. First, there is
his own chosen action: feeds on ashes. Ashes looks back to verses
15, 16, 19. When wood is reduced to its substantial reality, what
is it but ashes? The idol may impress, but it is in reality no more
than the substrate, the dead embers. Secondly, there is the inner
consequence of this choice: deluded. The idolater chose a
delusion and became deluded (Ps. 115:8). Who is the agent
behind this induced delusion? Is it the Lord acting in the
providential laws he has instituted that a false choice begets a false person? Is it the idol, the delusion producing its own likeness? Thirdly, there is the ensuing state of bondage. Cannot save ... right hand: the idolater picks up the figurine in his hand, holding it, but in reality it holds him. He is in bondage to a lie.
iv. Redemption from sin (44:21-23). See p. 264 for the place of this section in the overall scheme. The first element in the
280
ISAIAH 44:21-23
divine plan for Israel was redemption from Babylon (43:14-21).
The second element, redemption from sin, is now completed:
first, we are invited to enter into the mind of God (21-22), and,
secondly, to join in the responsive praise of the redeemed. The
tenses in verses 22-23 (return ... sing ... ) are either imperatives
commanding response, perfects expressing the determination of
the Lord (he has purposed redemption, therefore it is a sure fact),
or imperfect, forecasting what he will yet do.
21. Remember looks back broadly over the whole section
(43:22 — 44:20): remember your need of redemption (43:22-24),
my pledge of forgiveness and new life (43:25 — 44:5), and the
certainty of my promises, since I am the only God (44:6-20). To
remember stresses the primary importance of mind and memory
in God’s plan: God’s people should always first ponder the truth
they know. Made (lit. ‘formed’): unlike the idolater who forms
his god (12-13), here is a God who fashions his people (43:1),
shaping them for himself in all the experiences of life. Servant ...
servant: the repetition is surely deliberate and related to the fact
that a servant is a ‘bondman’, but, unlike the idolater in his blind
and unbreakable bondage (20), here is a position of privilege —
the servant of such a Lord, the ‘bondage’ of one who has been
brought out of bondage into the law of liberty (Ex. 20:1-3, etc.;
Rom. 6:17-—22; Jas. 1:22—25). Not forget: in parallel to the
remember with which the verse opens, we might expect the
corresponding negative, ‘do not forget’, but Isaiah neatly turns it
round: J will not forget you. In idolatry, everything depends on
the devotee, but here, everything depends on the living God.
Even should they forget, yet ‘I will not forget you’ (49:15).
22. Swept: ‘wiped’ as in 43:25. Offences: ‘rebellions’, the
wilful root of sin (43:25). Cloud ... mist: that which can be easily
obliterated as though it never was (Ho. 6:4; 13:3). Return ... for
...: coming back in repentance is not a good deed rewarded by
redemption; the redemption has already taken place, opening the
door for a return, making it both possible and effective. Redeemed (Nga’ al): see 35:9—10; 43:1, 14.
23. Sing: the picture of those who enter, with responsive joy,
into a salvation to which they have made no contribution (54:1)
but which has been achieved for them — hence for the LORD has
done this. Earth ... mountains ... forests: when the Lord
accomplishes redemption for his people, the curse is lifted from
the whole creation (Pss. 96:10ff.; 98:7ff., where ‘to judge the
earth’ has the meaning ‘to set everything to rights’; Rom. 8:19-
21). Trees: the idolater cut down trees, but redemption frees them
to joy in the Lord. Displays: an imperfect tense here; better ‘will
281
ISAIAH 44:24
display’, when the redemption he has accomplished is fully
evident in his people. Glory: ‘beauty’ (Eph. 4:24; 1 Jn. 3:2).
VIII. THE GREAT DELIVERANCE: THE WORK OF CYRUS (44:24 — 48:22)
Isaiah moves his subject forward a step. The Lord saw the needs
of his people in political and spiritual terms (42:18-25). He has
stated in outline that these needs will be met (42:18 — 43:21;
43:22 — 44:23). Now he turns to the question ‘How?’ As to the
political deliverance of exiled Israel, the Lord’s agent is his anointed ... Cyrus (45:1); and as to spiritual redemption, the
Lord’s Agent is my servant (49:3). In this way the two passages
of promise (42:18 — 43:21; 43:22 — 44:23) are paralleled by two
passages of fulfilment (44:24 — 48:22; 49:1 — 55:13).
The present section deals with three subjects: first, the work of
Cyrus (44:24 — 45:8); secondly, Israel’s reaction to Cyrus and the
Lord’s reassurances (45:9 — 46:13); and, thirdly, the fall of
Babylon (47:1-15) and the release of the captives (48:1—22).
a. Cyrus: builder and conqueror (44:24 — 45:8)
Three self-affirmations by the Lord hold this passage together.
The first is the broadest (44:24de; lit. ‘I am the Lord who does
everything’), a claim to total directive control of the universe; the
second (45:7c; lit. ‘I am the Lord who does all these things’)
claims direct responsibility for the Cyrus events, his mission to
Jerusalem, Judah and the temple (44:26—28) and his whole career
as conqueror (45:1—4); and the third (45:8f), J, the LORD, have
created it is, in context, most likely a perfect of determination: ‘I
have determined to create it? commits divine creative power to
the total enterprise, making it a direct, sole and unique act of
God. All this gives enormous solemnity to the passage: the Lord
is solely at work (44:24), wholly at work (45:7) and creatively at
work (45:8).
i. The Lord and his word (44:24-26b). The Lord who ‘does
ae (24) fulfils the word he has given to his messengers
24. Very often the things that the Lord does seem threatening to his people — and, as we shall see, the Cyrus plan was something they groused about (45:9-13; 46:8-13). The solution is rather to look at what God is, your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb: his loving sufficiency, he is the Redeemer, go’él, the Next-of-Kin, pledged to take and bear every burden as his own;
282 ‘
ISAIAH 44:25-28
in his purposeful love, he formed his people in the womb. They
are his family by his will (Jas. 1:18), and nothing will ever touch
them except what fatherly love directs. Alone stretched out ...
spread ...: his continuing work as Creator is the guarantee that he
ae sole charge of everything (40:26); there is no other god (Ps.
25-26b. False prophets translates baddim, used in 16:6, Job
11:3 and Jeremiah 48:30 in the sense ‘idle talk’; here and in
Jeremiah 50:36 of the pretentious claims of fortune-tellers. Makes
fools of: ‘bewitches, drives mad’. Since they choose folly, the
Lord will see to it that they become fools (44:18, 20)! Diviners
claimed special means of telling the future; the wise tried to apply
human wisdom to the task. Isaiah is not consigning all human
wisdom to the rubbish heap: in context, alongside diviners, there
is a ‘wisdom’ which tries to make sense of life, the flow of
history and the trends that lead from present to future and which
seeks to apply this helpfully to individual needs. But, compared
with the higher wisdom which orders all things, it is no more than
upside-down (overthrows) nonsense (1 Cor. 1:18-25). Yet the
word of the messengers (26b), those who carry God’s word,
which can so easily be scorned by worldly sophistication (28:7—
13), carries deeper and eternal truth. In this matter the Lord is
jealous of his position and no word but his will come to pass.
Predictions is simply ‘advice, counsel’ without any necessary
reference to forecasting.
ii. The Lord and his purpose (44:26c—28). Isaiah covers in
turn the restoration of Judah (26d—f), the opening of a way home
for the exiles (27) — the wording is deliberately reminiscent of the
crossing of the Red Sea, leaving Egypt, heading for home — and
the restored city and temple (28). Notice again the strong element
of reassurance. We are aided by hindsight, and we know that
Cyrus was, so to speak, ‘a good thing’. Israel in Babylon, however, saw only a greater conqueror on the way, and doubtless
said, ‘We could do without this.’ They wanted liberation, not
worse bondage. Hence the Lord literally wraps the reference to
Cyrus (28ab) in references to what the exiles actually wanted:
restoration (26), homecoming (27) and rebuilding (28cd). In the
Lord’s purposes, the good dominates and outlasts the harsh. (See
Additional Note on Cyrus, p. 284.)
28. My shepherd: kings were called ‘shepherds’ as being
guardians and carers of their people (56:11; 2 Sa. 24:17; 1 Ki.
22:17; Je. 2:8). The title here signifies that the coming conqueror
is the Lord’s appointed carer — even, as a shepherd would, to lead
283
ADDITIONAL NOTE
them into their proper pastures. Foundations: interestingly, as
Ezra records (3:10-13; 5:16), in the days of Cyrus the rebuilding
of the temple did not progress beyond the laying of the
foundations.
Additional Note on the prediction
of Cyrus in 44:28
Many see the detailed prediction of the personal name of Cyrus
in 44:28 as a problem, and suggest a variety of solutions. Those
who find difficulty with prediction place the author of the
prophecy in Babylon in the thick of the Cyrus events — the socalled ‘Second Isaiah’ (see pp. 28-33). In this case, the prediction
involved would be the prophet’s discernment of Cyrus as
liberator. The main difficulty with this view is that it does not
accord with what these chapters claim: that the prophet did not
forecast only the outcome of Cyrus’ career but also its inception (41:25-27). Furthermore, if the prophet was a resident in
Babylon, it is remarkable that his prophecy is totally lacking in
‘local colour’ — particularly that he envisaged situations for the
exiles which do not accord with their actual state (see on 42:22)
but resorts to conventional images; the same can be said of his poetical depiction of the fall of Babylon (47:1ff.).! Others would
argue, though, that it is essential to insist that the Old Testament
is our only source book on the subject of Old Testament
prophecy. We can, of course, choose to disbelieve what it says,
but we must not adjust its testimony to suit modern conventions,
tastes or prejudices. The evidence of the Old Testament (as of the
New) is that pre-knowledge of personal names is given when, for
whatever reason, the situation warrants it (cf 1 Ki. 13:2 with 2 Ki. 23:15-17; Acts 9:12). This special dimension of prediction is
at home in Isaiah, who, more than any other prophet, makes prediction and fulfilment the keystone of his proof that the Lord is the only God.
1 Smart (History and Theology in Second Isaiah) would remove all reference to Cyrus, treating it as a ‘reinterpretation’ of ‘Deutero-Isaiah’ by the fifth-century
Jerusalem community. It is perhaps sufficient comment to note Smart’s own
rebuke to those who would remove the name ‘Israel’ from 49:3, as ‘contrary to all
good procedure in the critical handling of texts’. Sadly, R. K. Harrison (Introduction to the Old Testament [Tyndale Press, 1970], p. 794) concurs with Smart. If the fact of predictive prophecy is accepted, we are in no position to set limits to its exercise, and, since the OT does not let us into the secrets of the mechanisms or ‘psychology’ of inspiration, we do not have the clues to decide what is possible and what is impossible. Within the total biblical context, the revelation of names is perfectly at home (see, e.g., Gn. 16:11; Mt. 1:21; Lk. 1e03)%
284
ISAIAH 45:1-6
iii. The Lord and his anointed (45:1-7). There is much in
this passage that Isaiah’s people could have accepted without
comment: that when a conqueror arises, ‘the authorities that
exist’ have been ‘established by God’ (1; Rom. 13:1); that the
conquering power they exercise is by divine gift (2-3), that
somehow the Lord’s own people are always at the centre of his
concern (4), and that the Lord is working out a worldwide plan
(6). But to call Cyrus the Lord’s anointed! That is quite a
different matter! This was in particular the kingly title. It was the
special dignity (1 Sa. 12:3, 5; 26:11; 2 Sa. 1:14, 16) and
sacrosanctity (1 Sa. 24:6, 10; 26:9, 11, 23) of Saul as king; above
all it was the divinely granted status of David (1 Sa. 16:6; Ps.
18:50; 132:10), of the Davidic king (Ps. 84:9) and of the expected
‘David’ of the future (Ps. 2:2). The vision of this coming Davidic
king had hitherto preoccupied Isaiah’s own depiction of the
future (1:24; 9:1-7; 11:1-16; 14:28-32; 16:4-5; 32:1; 33:17) —
but now the coming king, the Lord’s anointed, is not David at all
but a pagan named Cyrus! This was not at all what they wanted
to hear or the way they hoped the future would shape out. As we
shall see, this sense of recoil at what was proposed is essential to
understanding 45:1 — 46:13 (see on 45:9). But the Lord’s
purposes are always on a longer scale (Lk. 1:32—33) and a wider
canvas than humans can grasp, and filled with a more complex
wisdom (55:8).
1-3b. The unbroken success of Cyrus’ career from its early
origin in the distant kingdom of Anshan to his replacement of the
Babylonian empire by his own Persian empire was a matter of marvel to his contemporaries. They could see him only as
‘beloved of the gods’. Isaiah takes us behind the scenes to the
reality: it was the Lord who led him out on to the stage of history
(take hold of), fashioned the purpose Cyrus was to fulfil (to
subdue), engineered his triumphs (open doors), made his progress easy (/evel ... break ... cut) and enriched him with earth’s
treasures (3a). Verse 7 correctly sums up the Lord’s management
of history with ‘I do all these things’.
3c—6. So that you may know: Isaiah does not say that Cyrus
will come to know the Lord, but that the Lord has put all the
evidence before him to make such knowledge possible. Likewise,
in the Cyrus plan, the Lord has two other purposes in mind: the
welfare of his chosen people (for the sake of, 4; see 14:1—2) and
revelation to the world (6). As we shall learn (45:9-13; 46:1—13),
Israel remained blind and the watching world remained
uninformed. Cyrus was at the centre of the Lord’s purpose but
failed to fulfil that purpose. Mercifully, the Lord had another and
285
ISAIAH 45:7
more glorious person and plan waiting in the shadows (49:1 —
55:13)! Are we meant to ask how Cyrus could have come to
know the Lord? There can be no doubt how Isaiah would have
answered. When Cyrus entered Babylon, it would seem that all
the resident ‘gods’ rushed to claim the credit for his triumph.
Indeed, in the Cyrus Cylinder,’ Cyrus acknowledges Marduk as
the god behind his career in the same way that he gives the
glory to the Lord in Ezra 1:2. The gods had all won and all must
have prizes. Soldiering is an uncompromising occupation, but
the soldier-become-politician must exchange sword-in-hand for tongue-in-cheek. Yet (Isaiah would say), among all the claimant gods, only One was wise before the event; only One predicted
(not just the career and success of Cyrus but) his emergence in
world affairs— and even his name! The God who can thus predict
must be the only God (5-6). Cyrus had the evidence but he either
did not or would not face its implications.
7. The foregoing review of the career of Cyrus is summed up
in this magnificent statement of the Sole Energizer of history.
Light ... darkness stand here either as metaphorical, the delightful
as contrasted with the threatening aspects of life, or as literal, the
ordered sequence of day and night. Either way is true: the Lord is
executively behind all life’s experiences and the sustainer of its
regularities (Gn. 1:16; 8:22; Je. 31:35; 33:20).? Prosperity ...
disaster: the older, literal rendering ‘peace ... evil’ caused
unnecessary difficulties. Can the Lord ‘create evil’? Out of about
640 occurrences of the word ra‘, which range in meaning from a
‘nasty’ taste to full moral evil, there are about 275 cases where it
refers to trouble or calamity. Each case must be judged by its
context and NIV has done so correctly here. Cyrus was ‘bad news’
to the kings he conquered and the cities he overthrew. But
Isaiah’s (and the Bible’s) view of divine providence is rigorous —
and for that reason full of comfort. Sinful minds want the comfort
of a sovereign God but jib at saying with Job (2:10), ‘Shall
we accept good from God, and not trouble (ra‘)?’ But when we
1 For the Cyrus Cylinder, see D. W. Thomas (ed.), Documents from Old Testament Times (Nelson, 1958), pp. 92-94; D. J. Wiseman, ‘Cyrus’, in NBD, p. 250, It was a propagandist account, produced by the priests of Marduk to punish Nabonidus, and it therefore determined to leave no stone unturned in buttering up Cyrus as one raised by Marduk to punish Nabonidus. But, of course, Marduk kept all this to himself until after the event. 2 Light and darkness are typical themes in Zoroastrianism and this has been used to suggest a Persian milieu for this verse. This is grossly overpressing the occurrence of two well-known biblical motifs. In any case, the texts on which Zoroaster based his light/darkness dualism go back to about 1200 BC and could not therefore be used to establish a post-Isaianic date for this Passage.
286
ISAIAH 45:8
make it our confession that the God who ‘made all things’
(44:24) does all things (45:7), we find it ‘full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort’.'
iv. The Lord and his creative resolve (45:8).’ The truth
which 44:24 — 45:7 has stated plainly are now repeated pictorially. Earthly events have heavenly origins. The initiation,
continuation and climax of Cyrus’ career are the Lord’s doing:
just as he is the doer of all (44:24), so his word lies behind all
things (44:25-26) in their outcome (44:26-28), their details
(45:1, 3) and their motivation (45:3cd, 4ab, 6). It is exactly like
the way in which the fertilization of earth begins with the rain
from heaven.
Righteousness: the Lord’s absolutely right purpose for the
world and for his people as executed by Cyrus. Salvation: the
Lord’s purpose of deliverance for his people (from Babylon)
through Cyrus. These are the fruits on earth of the process set in
motion from heaven. To this the Lord commits himself in the
“perfect of determination’. Have created it: as ‘creation’ it is
something which by its newness and greatness can only be an act
of God; as past, created, it is an established certainty in the mind
and purpose of God; as yet to happen on earth it is something ‘I,
the Lord, have determined to create’.
b. Rebellion and resolve, quibbling and consolation
(45:9 — 46:13)
The ‘shape’ of this section is an important element in its meaning.
It is bracketed by matching passages (45:9-13; 46:1-13), each of
which covers the same ground. The quarrelsome folk addressed
in 45:9-10 appear again as rebels in 46:8; the reaffirmation of the
Cyrus plan (45:11-13) is repeated in 46:1-7, 11-13. Each
passage is full of divine comfort for troubled Israel: Jerusalem
will be rebuilt and the exiles freed (45:13), the Lord continues to
carry his people on his broad shoulders (46:3-4). History may not
look as if it is shaping out for the welfare of God’s people but
nevertheless it is! Within these bracketing passages, 45:14—25
takes up the topic of the place of Israel in the Lord’s purposes for
the world. The Cyrus plan would not succeed in revealing the
Lord on a worldwide scale; the then Israel may think that Cyrus

the meaning is plain. NIV handles the Hebrew ‘broadly’ but offers an accurate

is the negation of the universal hopes they entertained, but the
Lord is not deserting his intention that one day all the ends of the
earth will turn ... and be saved (45:22-23). To the embarrassment of those who rebelled and quibbled, there will be an
Israel of God exulting in praise (45:24cd, 25).
i. The potter and the parent (45:9-13). 9-11. The Cyrus plan
has been announced as the Lord’s purpose bringing to Israel the
blessings of restoration to home, city and temple (44:26-28).
Why, then, should there be quibbling where we might expect
joyful anticipation? But their problem was real, and their
grousing had real substance. When they had lived in Jerusalem
before the exile, it was as a subject people under a puppet king.
However misconceived their successive rebellions against their overlords of Assyria and Babylon had been, they were evidence
of a strong groundswell of longing to be a sovereign state under a
Davidic king. Of course, far from achieving this, their rebellions
had in fact only hastened the end of kingdom, king, land, city and
temple. But now, to be told that the exile will end through a
pagan king and their home-going will be as a still-subject people
with a city and temple rebuilt by his direction — and without any
reference to a Davidic restoration — why, they would be even
worse off than before! The quarrelling arose, then, not from hurt pride at being under an obligation to a pagan, but from, if
anything, a worse condition than had prevailed before the exile.
Then at least there was a Davidic king in Jerusalem, however
much on sufferance! Now they could see only a cruel blow to
their hopes, the exchange of one bondage for another. To all this
the prophet makes a twofold reply: it is impossible for the artefact to question the potter (9), and impermissible for the child
to question the parent (10). The potter exercises an unquestionable sovereignty; the parent possesses a sole right. Maker (11): ‘potter/fashioner’.
12-13. Our preoccupation with how the creation began does
not allow us to see the significance of the claim here. In the Old
Testament the Creator is not only the One who began everything,
but also the One who maintains everything in existence, controls and guides everything. Hence, if he decides to raise up Cyrus (13), that is the end of the discussion! Not for a price: the Creator has not struck a bargain with Cyrus! Both his uprising (raise up is ‘wake up/rouse up’ as 41:2, 25), his ease of conquest (ways straight) and his function (rebuild and set ... free) are a sovereign dictate of the LoRD Almighty, ‘the LorD of hosts’ (1:4), the One who is in himself every potentiality and power. .

ISAIAH 45:14
ii. An unchanged worldwide purpose for Israel (45:14—25).
This passage replies to the unspoken assumption behind verses
9-13 (and 46:1—13) that the Davidic promises have been lost in a
Gentile take-over. It was part of the Davidic vision that the
promised king would rule the nations (9:7; 11:12—16; Ps. 2:7—12)
and that they would submit to him (7:23; Ps. 72:8-12). Isaiah
does not relate the present passage explicitly to the Davidic hope, but its content is inseparable from the expectation of the king
who is to come. There are two divisions, 14-17 and 18-25, each
beginning with This is what the LORD says (14a, 18a) and each
ending with the triumph of Israel (17, 25). In verses 14-17 the
keynote is the centrality of Israel in the Lord’s worldwide plans
as Gentiles submit to Israel on the ground that the only God is
found among them (14); in 18-25 the keynote is the reality of coequal membership in the Israel of God as Gentiles respond to the
universal invitation to turn to the Lord and be saved. (Cf the
vision of ‘one world, one people, one Lord’, 19:24-25; 27:12- 13
14-17, The submission of the world. On 9:1-7 we noted an
apparent clash of ideas: the victory of the child-king was by force
of arms (4-5), yet the spread of his kingdom was in reality a
spreading peace (7). In 11:1-16 the perfect Davidic King copies
his ancestor by military conquest of Philistia, Moab and Edom
(14). Isaiah was simply being faithful to the kingly motif. Kings
extend their realms by way of arms, conflict, victory and subjugation. So, here, the way to Israel’s God is through submissive
union with Israel. It was the way that Moab’s pride refused to
take (16:5—6) and there is no other way. The true and only God
revealed himself to one people only; he set up the way of
approach to himself in one place only, the Jerusalem temple and
its sacrifices. 14. The nations do not come out of weakness, for they bring
their wealth (products ... merchandise) with them; they have not
lost their natural vigour or prowess (fall). They come seriously
(over to you ... yours); they take second place (not trudge but
simply ‘walk/come after you’, following where you lead); they
come humbly (in chains ... bow down); they come earnestly
(plead); they come for God’s sake, as in 2:2-4. National barriers
are transcended (come over), actual membership is realized
(yours) and a new lifestyle adopted (‘walk after’). Egypt ... Cush
... Sabeans: see 43:3. Isaiah is using exodus symbols: the nations
then subordinated to Israel typify those who will one day seek for
themselves the blessings Israel has in the Lord. Jo you ... yours
... behind you ... before you: the pronoun is feminine singular
289
ISAIAH 45:15-19
throughout. This may be a deliberate ploy in case a masculine
pronoun might be understood to refer to Cyrus. ;
‘15-17. Hides himself: this allegation could be the voice of the
converts from among the nations, late-comers to the revelation of
the only God; it could be Israel’s (or Isaiah’s) comment that the
Cyrus plan seems to negate the Davidic promises, but not so. The
submission of Israel to the Gentiles will yet be swallowed up in
the submission of the Gentiles to Israel. God and Saviour of
Israel (lit. ‘God of Israel, Saviour’): the God of Israel is the Saviour of the world. Isaiah has a universal view of salvation, but
not a universalist doctrine: salvation is for all, but not all will be
saved. Go off (16) is ‘walk’, the verb translated ‘trudge’ in verse
14. These are the alternative destinies: those who will not walk
after Israel will walk into shame. Saved ... salvation (17): when
verse 15 describes the God of Israel as Saviour it refers to
worldwide salvation. Therefore, the /srael here saved ... with an everlasting salvation cannot be one nation to the exclusion of the
world; it must be the whole company of the saved, what Paul will
yet call ‘the Israel of God’ (Gal. 6:16).
25, The salvation of the world. Isaiah spells out more
explicitly the gathering of a worldwide people into the salvationcommunity. He speaks of God in creation (18), revelation (19),
salvation (20-22) and affirmation (23-25).
18. For: this passage is offered in explanation of the preceding
passage. How are we to understand this worldwide salvation and
the world Israel? First, God is the Creator who had a worldwide ©
people in mind when he created the earth. Four verbs sum up his
work: he initiated (created), moulded into shape (fashioned, as a
potter would) until all was completed (made) and he imparted
stability to the whole (founded). This work of creation proves that
he is God (Ps. 96:5). It is also purposeful: empty is toh (24:10;
29:21; 40:17; 41:29; 44:9), see especially Jeremiah 4:23-25, a
desolate, unstable, meaningless thing without light or life. When
the Lord planned the world he also willed a worldwide people
(formed ... to be inhabited). It stands to reason therefore that this Creator will have a concern for all his creatures.
19. Secondly, the world vision of verses 14-17 is to be
understood in the light of revelation. In quiet rebuke of the allegation (15) that he ‘hides himself’, the Lord asserts that he never spoke in secret (lit. ‘under cover’): his word was openly available; nor in a land of darkness where one might lose one’s way: his word was intrinsically plain and straightforward; and it led them straight to himself: his word was not in vain (tohi, 18), solid ground not shifting sand. What he said was truth and right:
290
ISAIAH 45:20-21
the former is ‘righteousness’, conformity to the absolute norm of
divine truth; the latter is ‘plain, straightforward’, without deviance or duplicity. The link with verse 15, seen in the contrast
between hides and not ... in secret, makes 19 a comment on the
matter of the Gentile hope: if Israel had heeded the word spoken
to them, they would have known that their God, the Creator, had
plans for the whole inhabited world. Such was, for example, plain
in the Abrahamic promise (Gn. 12:2—3; 22:18) and in the vision
of a worldwide Davidic kingdom (9:6-—7).
Thirdly, verses 20-25 describe how this universal gathering
will actually come about.' The general invitation to gather ...
Jrom the nations (20) is supported by drawing a contrast between
gods of wood (20c) and the only God (21f), between gods that
cannot save (20d) and a righteous God and a Saviour (21g). This
distinction rests on proof: who foretold this ...? (21cd). Consequently, since the only God has proved his reality by prediction
and fulfilment and has affirmed himself to be a Saviour, the
general invitation (20a) can be particularized as an invitation to
be saved (22). This invitation, in turn, rests on the integrity of the
word of God (23ab): this one, saving God has gone on oath that
all the earth will own him (23de). Not all will be saved (24cd),
but the worldwide /srae/ will share the divine nature (‘righteous’,
25b).
20. Fugitives (palit, lit. ‘escapers’) implies danger, the danger
of lingering where there is no salvation (20d), of choosing
pretend gods and meriting shame (16, 24cd; 42:13, 17). Carry
about: i.e. in processions, but Isaiah’s irony sees in the ‘carrying
about’ the helpless inertness of such gods. Gods: literally ‘a god.’
Isaiah, with further irony, uses the noun ’é/, the word for God the
transcendent! Imagine claiming to be ‘God’ over all and yet being
‘non-salvific’ (lit.) — their inability to save is not a momentary
lapse but an inherent condition.
21 describes a brief court scene. As ever in these chapters,
deity is demonstrated by prediction and by the control of history
that brings prediction to fulfilment. This is the gathering to the
Lord of a worldwide people. In essence it is a prediction which
goes back to Abraham (Gn. 12:1-3; 22:18); it has been a
recurring feature of Isaiah (2:2-4; 9:1; 11:10; 19:23-15; 25:6-9;
1 A common interpretation is that the fugitives (20b) are those who have
survived the conquests of Cyrus and consequently appreciate what the Lord has
done. This (21c) refers to Cyrus’ career, by the foretelling of which the Lord
demonstrated his unique deity. All this fits broadly with these chapters, but poorly
in the immediate context and in the structure of 44:24 — 48:22.
291
ISAIAH 45:22-25
27:13; 42:1-4). Righteous looks back in the first instance to verse
19 (where ‘truth’ is, lit., ‘righteousness’). Thus it refers to the
trustworthiness of the word God speaks, so that when he invites
the fugitives to gather, they can rely on his invitation. But more, a
righteous God is one who is eternally true to himself and can be
guaranteed to act in ways that satisfy his own nature. Paul S
allusion to this verse in Romans 3:26 is fully justified. Saviour:
literally ‘saving’. His work of salvation is not a momentary urge
but an eternal attribute.
22. Turn: Numbers 21:89 illustrates this perfectly. Be saved:
Hebrew often uses an imperative to express the absolute certainty
with which a result will follow: ‘Just turn to me and your
salvation will be certain beyond all doubt.’ The invitation is for
everybody, all you ends of the earth. God: Isaiah uses ’él (cf
20d) but here with its full implication: the only, transcendent,
saving God. 23a—c. By myself ... sworn: word for word as in the
Abrahamic promise (Gn. 22:16; cf Heb. 6:13). My mouth: just as
‘to see with the eyes’ (Dt. 4:3) is to see personally, so ‘to speak
with the mouth’ is to make a personal statement. Jnfegrity: ‘righteousness’, a word invested with the Lord’s own character,
expressive of his purpose, totally trustworthy. Not revoked: cf.
Sorby
23d—25. Here, then, is the ‘righteous word’: (a) there will be
universal submission to the Lord expressed by knee (submission)
and tongue (acclamation) (23de; Phil. 2:9-11); (b) though all
submit, not all turn savingly to the Lord (24): some are looking to
the LORD alone (24a), but others have rage in their hearts — the
enforced submission of unreconciled foes — and go away into
shame (24cd); (c) the saved company is called the descendants of
Israel (Ps. 87). Swear: i.e. ‘swear allegiance’. Righteousness is
plural, signifying ‘true righteousness, righteousness in all its
fullness’, that is to say, all that makes his people right with God,
conformity to his character and requirements. This inner reality is
matched by strength to live out this new relationship and status.
Will come to him: it is hard to think what this might mean in
relation to those who maintain their rage against the Lord, and very likely NIV’s estimate of the Hebrew cannot be sustained. Certainly the lines could be translated differently: ‘Each will say of me, “In the Lord alone ...”. Right up to him shall each come, but ashamed shall all be who enrage themselves against him.’ In other words, along with the status of righteousness and the en- duement with strength comes the privilege of access. Raged ... righteous: like the parallel 14-17, verses 18-25 end with two
292
ISAIAH 46; 1-2
statements side by side: those who reap shame (24cd, cf 16), and
the saved Israel (25, cf 17). Raged: a reflexive participle, ‘keep
themselves incensed’, a decisive commitment to their gods
involving sustained animosity towards any counter-claim. Descendants (lit. ‘seed’) of Israel: a merely national significance of
Israel would make nonsense of the whole argument from verse
14 onwards. The Lord has promised and predicted worldwide
salvation, and here, as in 17, the honoured name of /srael casts its
mantle over a worldwide confessing community. Within the
community there are not first- and second-class citizens: the
description descendants (lit. ‘seed’) indicates reality of belonging
and co-equality of status. All are ‘born there’ (Ps. 87:46). In
verse 24 righteousness (the new status before the Lord) brought
with it strength for daily life and fellowship with the saving God;
here the righteous respond with exultant praise.
iii. The unchanging Lord and his stubborn rebels (46:1-
13). These verses are both parallel to and different from 45:9-13.
Both passages expose Israel’s opposition to the Cyrus plan (45:9-
10; 46:8, 12) and reaffirm that, none the less, the plan will go
forward: the Lord can be as stubborn as his people (45:13; 46:10-
11, 13)! — but 46:1-13 majors on the Lord’s care for them (3-4)
and also goes beyond the earlier passage in the severity of its
condemnation of rebellious Israel. In other words, while 46:1—13
fundamentally says the same thing as 45:9-13, it also takes into
account the material traversed in 45:14~25, that Israel is central
to the Lord’s world purposes and that, in all he does, he
safeguards them as special and therefore is prepared to expose
unsparingly (8, 12) how exceedingly culpable is their opposition.
Isaiah expresses this in a vigorous poem in five sections.
1-2, The burdening gods. Isaiah 44:24-28 heralded the
advent of Cyrus and 45:1-8 saw him launched on his dazzling
career. Now the heart of the matter as regards Israel is imminent
— the fall of Babylon — and we are given privileged seats as the
great ‘gods’ of Babylon sway down from their pedestals to lie
prone on wagons to be unceremoniously carted off from the
doomed city. It did not happen, of course, in this way. Isaiah is
dealing with pictures and principles (see on 10:28-32); his
purpose is not to describe but to expose. There is no recorded
evacuation of Babylon in anticipation of Cyrus’ assault, but in a
strikingly visual way Isaiah presents the truth that these gods
cannot save (cf, 2:20) and, when the crunch comes, are themselves dependent on pack-animals! Bel (1, the same title as Baal,
‘lord’) is Marduk, the patron god of Babylon; Nebo, Bel’s son,
293
ISAIAH 46:3—7
was patron of nearby Borsippa. He was the god of wisdom, and
was carried annually to Babylon to accompany his father in the
New Year processions and to write on ‘tables of destiny’ what
the coming year held for Babylon. He apparently got it wrong
about Cyrus! Burdensome: literally ‘loaded up’ — like so many
great parcels! In 703 BC when Sennacherib attacked Babylon,
Merodach-Baladan organized just such an evacuation of the
‘gods’. It is thus within his own times that Isaiah finds the components of this picture. The burden (2) is the ‘gods’ themselves,
and they is the supposed spiritual entity behind the visible image,
but there is nothing there to intervene.
3-4, The burden-bearing God. Just as verses 1-2 move
‘chronologically’ forward to the approach of Cyrus to Babylon,
so Isaiah addresses the Israel of that time, those who have survived the captivity or have been born in exile. The fact of
captivity and the experience of exile do not contradict the fact
that their God has been carrying them and continues to do so.
They have changed — the child in the womb (conceived), the
infant growing through adolescence to adulthood (since birth),
the onset of grey hairs in old age — but one thing remains
unchanging: the burden-bearing God (upheld ... carried ...
sustain), ‘Who was and is the same,/And evermore shall be;
/Jehovah, Father, great I AM’.' Upheld: the same verb as
burdensome (lit. ‘loaded up’, 1): ‘who have been loaded (on
me)’, been my burden. In verse 4, except for J will rescue, all the
pronouns J are emphatic, ze. ‘I will myself’ — a touching
underlining of directly personal tender loving care. J will rescue
is expressed as a co-ordinate verb with sustain, so as to say that
rescuing is not a separate act but intrinsic to the service automatically rendered to his people by the burden-bearing God.
Sustain (sabal, ‘to shoulder’) ... carry (ndsa’): if any difference
is to be pressed, the former is ‘to accept a burden’, the latter ‘to take up a burden’ (see 53:11—12).
_ 5-7, The made gods, unable to save. The contrast established
in verses 1—2 and 3-4 is further emphasized. Compare (5) refers
to a general resemblance (as of a ‘family likeness’), a belonging to the same group. Equal means to ‘be on level terms’, equality of status or capacity. The Lord denies that he belongs to a category labelled ‘god’ in which others too are found; then he goes on to assert that, even were such the case, he cannot be equalled in his divine attributes and acts. Liken (Vmdsal, the verb used of making one thing a ‘parable’ of another) denies that there
1 From T. Olivers, ‘The God of Abraham praise’.
294
ISAIAH 46:8-11
is any point of comparison. Fundamentally there cannot be any
point of contact between the God who says ‘it is I who have
made’ (4) and the ‘gods’ who owe their origin to earthly
substances (gold ... silver, 6), human activity (pour), precision
(weigh), expenditure (hire) and skill (goldsmith). No wonder
Isaiah ends with the scornful (lit.) ‘forsooth bow to it!’ The
disastrous exposure of idols continues with their lifelessness in
themselves (7): dependence on their devotees for movement (Jift
... Carry), intrinsic immobility (set ... stands), and the absurdity
of such a ‘god’ as the object of prayer and the hope of salvation.
8-11, The living God. This passage (with 12-13) turns out to
be Isaiah’s final appeal to Israel to accept the Lord’s will and trust
his providence.
8. Remember: the way through a problem is to think about
God: in particular to recall who he is and what he has done. ‘His
love in time past/Forbids me to think/He’ll leave me at last.’!
But it is hard to cut through disappointment and bewilderment to
this point of comfort. Israel wanted a Davidic restoration and
they got Cyrus! What a disappointment! They were nonplussed
by what their God was doing. Yet they had to heed a record of
age-long divine care (3-4; Ps. 77:7—20, esp. 10). Fix ... in mind:
the verb V’asas is found only here, and meanings like ‘to be firm’
have been suggested. The oldest interpretation relates it to the
noun ’is, ‘a man’, and hence ‘to act as a man would, take a
rational account of things’. Of the suggested emendations, that to
’aSam (‘to be guilty’) is the most suitable. The form here would
mean ‘acknowledge yourselves guilty’. But there is no use pretending that our knowledge of Hebrew — either in vocabulary or
meaning — is anything like complete, and ‘prove yourselves men’
could well be the prophet’s intention. He has been contending
against the sheer stupidity of idolatry. Israel did and could know
better — if only they would take a thoughtful account of things as
humans should. Take to heart: give serious thought to.
9. Former things: all the Lord has done in the period indicated
in verses 3-4. I am God (9b) should have an initial ‘For’. The
recollection of all that has gone before is meaningful because it is
God who has so acted and he cannot change. God ... God: the
former is ’é/, God in his transcendent deity; the latter ’elohim,
God in the fullness of his divine attributes. He is the only (no
other) and unique (none like) God. 10-11. End ... beginning ... still to come: i.e. the whole sweep
of history, from its inception to the things still in process, and on
1 From J. Newton, ‘Begone, unbelief; my Saviour is near’.
295
ISAIAH 46:12—13
to the end, is under his sovereign rule. He does not await the turn
of events and then wonder what to do about them: they all
emerge in order on the stage of history (like the stars, 40:26) at
the dictate of his word (J make known, lit. ‘declare’). From
ancient times is just ‘from beforehand’. My purpose will stand: in
a word, the Lord is a God whois truly God. As in creation (Ps.
33:9), so in history, he cannot be thwarted or gainsaid. Even.
when some particular in human experience bothers his people, it
is still the unalterable will of God. Here, the Lord does not conceal or alter the Cyrus plan. He comes as a rapacious victor
(bird of prey, 11) under the compulsion of the divine will
(purpose). God has spoken (said), God will act (bring about); it
is the product of divine wisdom (planned) and backed by divine
action (do). 12-13, The saving God. Verses 10-11 have dealt with the will
of God in the abstract. Isaiah now voices reassurances about the
way God’s will always works out for his people. Sadly they are in
this instance stubborn-hearted, ‘mighty in heart’, precisely our
idea ‘headstrong’; far from righteousness. Righteousness is (as
always) ‘that which is right with God’. They refuse to align
themselves with his righteous purposes. Nevertheless, his will is
righteousness ... Salvation ... splendour (13). It embodies and
implements all the Lord’s absolutely right purposes, brings
salvation/ deliverance to his people and is designed for their (lit. )
‘beauty’, i.e. to make them the lovely thing he desires them to be.
The idolater makes a god in his own image; the Lord intends to make his people in his.
c. Free at last (47:1 — 48:22)
Seventy long years had passed since the first exiles were deported
from Jerusalem. Life in Babylon was far from oppressive (Je.
29), but there were still those who were gripped by the insatiable
longing for Zion (Ps. 137). For them the day of salvation/
deliverance (48:20-21) could hardly dawn quickly enough. But
come it did, and, in the end, with all the lightning speed of which Cyrus was famously capable. It is on all this that Isaiah now meditates: the fall of Babylon (47:1-15) and the call to the captives to go home (48:1—22). The prophet had foreseen that Cyrus would release the captives (44:24-28) and conquer Babylon (45:1—8) — putting first what was most important to him. He now deals with these topics in chronological order.
i. Pride before a fall (47:1-15). In October 539 Bc, Cyrus advanced into lower Mesopotamia and, leaving Babylon till last,
296
ISAIAH 47:1-7
conquered and occupied the surrounding territory. Seeing which
way the wind was blowing, Nabonidus of Babylon deserted his
city, leaving it in the charge of his son, Belshazzar. For whatever
reason, the taking of Babylon was as bloodless and effortless as
Daniel 6 implies. Certainly the priests of Marduk, Babylon’s
patron god, had their noses put out of joint by Nabonidus’
religious fervour for other gods, and the Cyrus Cylinder represents Marduk as accompanying Cyrus on the march and ‘made
him enter his town ... sparing Babylon any calamity’. Very likely
the priests of Marduk connived with Cyrus and secured his entry
while Belshazzar feasted. But of all this drama Isaiah says
nothing! This would be impossible to explain if indeed we are
dealing with a ‘Second Isaiah’ resident in the city at the time.
Chapter 47 looks meditatively at the situation: Babylon fell
because of divine vengeance (1-7), pride (8-11) and the impotence of false religion (12-15).
1-7, Divine vengeance applied and explained. 1. Babylon is
humbled (dust; cf. 4:1), deprived of former glory (without a
throne) and repute (no more ... called). Tender ... delicate: what
is easily hurt and what needs shielding from life’s roughnesses.
2-4. Babylon has new experiences (2—3b): the cosseted girl of
verse 1 works like a slave (millstones), goes as a naked captive
into exile (Jift up, lit. ‘strip off’, ... legs ... streams, cf. 43:2), and
suffers sexual violation (nakedness ... shame). Behind all this
dire suffering lies the Lord’s vengeance (3c). The word used
(ndqam) expresses equivalence between offence and requital.
Babylon’s downfall is but her just due. Spare (3d): the verb ‘to
meet’ adapts its meaning to its context (cf Gn. 23:8, ‘intercede’;
Jas) 1677, “touch ; 1 Sa)-10:5, meet’; 1 Ki. 2:32, ‘attack’ ); here
(as in 64:5) it means ‘to meet with favour’, or simply ‘to favour’.
The situation has to be one of ‘no quarter’. Verse 4 adds three
comments. First, in the overthrow of Babylon the Lord acted
for Israel’s sake (cf 14:1—2). He is his people’s Redeemer, the
Next-of-Kin shouldering his kinsperson’s need (41:14; 43:14;
44:6, 24). Secondly, he demonstrated his almighty power: LORD
Almighty, ‘of hosts’ (1:9). Thirdly, he acted in holiness: the Holy
One of Israel (1:4). Such is the way the world is run: by an
almighty God, acting in holiness, centralizing and meeting his
people’s needs. , 5-7. Babylon loses authority (silence replaces dictating the
rules to others, 5), liberty (the darkness of the dungeon, cf 42:7)
and status (queen). As in 10:5—15, though Babylonian action
against my people ... my inheritance (6ab) was formally within
the will of God, it was nevertheless an offence to him. It was not
297
ISAIAH 47:8-11
that the situation got out of the Lord’s control and Babylon
inflicted more than was deserved. Their sin lay in the assumptions behind their actions and in their manner: pitilessness (no
mercy, 6d; specifically ‘compassion’, tender feeling that should
have restrained them), indiscriminateness (even on the aged, 6€),
arrogance (for ever ... eternal queen, 7b), absence of moral
thoughtfulness (did not consider ... what might happen, 7c; lit.
‘the outcome of it’). The holy will of the holy God must be done
in a way suited to that holiness — personally as well as collectively. The Old Testament does not subscribe to the view that
‘war is war’ — a situation where the moral and humanitarian
restraints which ordinarily operate are in abeyance and where outrageous deeds can be done with impunity. It does not believe
that national needs justify what would be criminal if done by a
private individual (e.g. Am. 1:3, 6, 9, 11, 13). Babylon assumed a
right to tenure (continue), authority (queen) and immunity (what
might happen) — ever the blind spots of the imperialist and of
those at the top. Consider: ‘lay to heart’, take a thoughtful view.
Reflect ... happen should be rather stronger: ‘remember ... the outcome’. It is not a matter of ‘might happen’ but of ‘remem- bering’ that they live in a moral world ruled by a holy God in which crime and punishment are inseparable.
8-11, Things which merit judgment. The single word ‘pride’
well expresses the accusations levelled as justifying the fall of
Babylon, but in particular there was self-assurance for present
and future (8), and moral complacency (10). To each is added the
warning that the disasters these sins merit cannot be averted
either by spiritual (9) or by financial (11) measures.
8-9. Saying to yourself: Babylon is overheard. Wanton is
rather ‘(self-)indulgent’ or ‘pampered’, the opposite of the widow
in her unprotected, unprovided state, and sheltered from the
blows like Joss of children. It is not that there is anything wrong
with possessing and enjoying the good things (1 Tim. 6:17); it is
a matter of the spirit with which such privileges are viewed. Babylon saw them as no more than was her right (8cd). Pam- pering replaced by poverty (widowhood, 9), joy by bitter bereavement (children) — and on a single day! The future which Babylon ignored (7) brings the tragedies which Babylon dismissed (8). Sorceries ... spells: the word translated spells means ‘bonds’, with the idea here of entering into ‘associations’ with occult powers in order to ‘bind’ the future; sorceries are the incantations used to invoke these powers. 10-11. Here is the astonishing optimism of all who say there is no God and no life to come. They opt for a world without moral
298
ISAIAH 47:12-15
consequences. Such is a misleading wisdom (in the practical
guidance of life) and knowledge (the conceptual background or
philosophy of life). These in turn arise out of a view of oneself:
self-sufficiency (J am) and unaccountability — no-one besides me;
in this context, no authority outside myself to which I must
render an account. Disaster is the word translated wickedness in
verse 10a. They chose ‘wickedness’ and ‘wickedness’ they will
get! Conjure it away: this translation can be justified by appeal
outside Hebrew to cognate languages; the Hebrew more plainly
means ‘you will not know its dawn’, the thought of unexpectedness matching the suddenness with which the verse
ends. Ransom (Vkapar): specifically ‘ransom price’. The disaster
cannot be bought off. Cannot foresee is ‘do not know’, i.e.
unprecedented.
12-15, Religion that failed. True religion gives strength in
time of need (12) and a sufficient understanding of what the
future holds (13). The time of trouble exposes false religion as
unable to save (14) and its officiants as inadequate — or selfseeking (15).
12-13. Spells ... sorceries: see verse 9. Keep on: what sadness
lies in this command! Those who do not know the true God have
no other recourse than to continue in self-effort (laboured) and
uncertainty (perhaps). All the counsel (13) is ‘the abundance of’,
a reference to the conflicting ideologies and directives of polytheism and (today as then) the conflicting counsel of astrology.
Astrologers are here ‘those who divide the heavens’, i.e. into the
various signs of the Zodiac. What is coming: cf. 41:5—7, the rush
of business in the idol factory in the face of coming events.
14-15. In fact false religion, far from offering protection (12),
only adds fuel to the fire. Stubble: see 5:24. Far from saving
others (13), they cannot even save themselves. No fire: false
religion may seem to offer the warmth of ‘helpfulness’, but it is
not a fire to sit by, rather a fire which will burn up, a furnace of
destruction. Trafficked with should be ‘trafficked with you’.
Babylon /aboured at its religion but the religious officiants were
making a trade out of it. Consequently, when the bottom dropped
out of their market, each of them goes (lit. ‘wanders off, making
his exit’). Save: on Vyasa’ here and Vndsal in verse 14, see 25:9.
ii. Home, yet not home (48:1-22). In this chapter Isaiah
heralds the departure of the exiles from Babylon and their
embarkation on a protected journey home — a mini-exodus (20—
21). Thus Cyrus has fulfilled his vocation within the plan of God
(44:26-28) in the manifesto of deliverance sketched in 42:18 —
279
ISAIAH 48:1-22
43:21. Step by step the prophet’s theme develops. Alongside the
joy of deliverance and the prospect of home-coming, however,
lies another, and darker, truth. With a suddenness that has led
some commentators to pronounce it a later intrusion into the text,
verse 22 states flatly that there is no peace for the wicked. But,
abrupt though it is, a careful reading of the chapter shows that it
is not inappropriate. Who is this people delivered from Babylon
and shepherded home? They are people who have forfeited the
right to the name Israel (1-2), stubborn (4), idolatrous (5), inattentive, uncomprehending, treacherous and a rebel (8). So
savage and unrelenting is this tide of indictment that again commentators have wondered how it could originate in one
whom they call (from 40:1) ‘the prophet of comfort’. How can he
be so ‘uncomfortable’? But we should rather ask if, in the light of
his development of his theme from 38:1 onwards, Isaiah could
have spoken here in any other terms. After all, it was the dire sin
of unbelief that landed the people in Babylon in the first place
(39:1-8). They are obsessed by morbid self-pity (40:27); the
Lord’s blind servant (42:18), in bondage for failing his law; spiritually insensitive to chastisement (42:21—22, 25); culpably
blind and deaf (43:8); weary of the Lord and corrupting true
religion (43:22—24); stung by nationalistic pride into rejecting the
Cyrus plan and impervious to warning (45:9-13), reassurance (45:14—25) and appeal (46:1—-13); arguing with the Lord beyond
the point of possibility and propriety (45:9ff.); rebellious (46:8),
stubborn (46:12) and far from righteousness (46:12). Thus
chapter 48 stands out from chapters 38 — 47, not because it is
alien but because it is climactic. What is diffused throughout the
earlier chapters is concentrated here into one. To return home
from Babylon, then, is not to come home to God: there is no
peace for the wicked. A change of address is not a change of
heart. Great as was the deliverance from political captivity, peace
with God, deliverance from sin, is another matter altogether and
has yet to be accomplished. But this too is announced here in principle. Verses 3-6b and 6c-7 deal respectively with former things and new things; in the broadly parallel sections of chapter
48 (1-11, 12-22) the matching verses supply the interpretation: the former things are the Cyrus plan (14-15), and the new things begin with the advent of the Servant (16).' In faithfulness the
! Jsaiah uses ‘former things’ and ‘new things’ flexibly. ‘Former things’ can be the general past (41:22), events linked with the coming conqueror (44:29), or the exodus (43:9, 18); ‘new things’ are the ministry of the Servant (42:9) and the return from Babylon (43:19); the context decides. Here, to class the former things
300
ISAIAH 48:1-6b
Lord has kept the Cyrus promises, but he has yet more in store for his people.
1-2, Israel described: unreality. An honoured name (1b), an
impeccable pedigree (1c), a true religious allegiance (lde), a
privileged citizenship (2a) and a mighty God (2bc) to rely on —
but (1f) it is all unreal. There is no genuineness (truth) in it, nor
does it satisfy the standards of God (righteousness).
1. Jacob ... Israel ... Judah: respectively, the people in their
origin, their covenant status and their particular ancestry. Line:
‘waters’ (see Dt. 33:28; Ps. 68:26). Take oaths: swear allegiance.
Invoke: engage in the whole round of religious practice by which
they called on the name of the Lord.
2. Call yourselves citizens is ‘call themselves after’. Isaiah
narrows the focus down: Jacobites (1a), Israelites (1b), Judahites
(1c), and now Jerusalemites. A proud claim — and all without
reality. The same applies to the narrowest focus of all: rely on the
God of Israel. This brings us into the realm of personal trust.
Taken simply by themselves, these words would be the hallmark
of genuineness in religion, the element that turns all other
spiritual and religious activities into gold, but in context this too
is marked as unreal. The Hebrew of verse 2 has an introductory
word (ki) omitted by NIV. It requires here the translation ‘though’,
thus exposing as hollow both of their claims, that of citizenship
and that of personal faith. The LORD Almighty is his name: when
this expression was used in 47:4 it underlined the almightiness of
the Lord as world ruler, the One with power and authority to take
vengeance on Babylon. In 48:2 the Lord faces a very different
situation: the total failure of those who claim to be his people.
But he is ‘the Lord of hosts’ in this situation also: he can deal
with it. They have failed but he is not beaten. As ‘the LORD’,
he revealed the meaning of his name, Yahweh, when he came
to Egypt to bring his people out of the jaws of death. Their
claim to be his is an unreal claim, but he affirms that he
remains the God of Israel. Once again he will prove himself their
Saviour. 3-6b, The former things: blessing for the unworthy. The
Cyrus events (see pp. 296-297) were the subject of prediction
as simply the rise of Cyrus and the new things as the return (Skinner) is
impermissible, for in this passage the former things must be favourable to Israel
and there is nothing at all favourable in the advent of the conqueror as such.
Whybray sees the new things as the fall of Babylon and the return but, on his
Deutero-Isaiah hypothesis, how can this be? What would be ‘new’ and unheard of
beforehand in something already predicted by Jeremiah and Ezekiel?
301
ISAIAH 48:6c-I1
long before he made his appearance (3). The reason for this
anticipatory prediction was the spiritual infidelity of a people
wedded to idols. The argument Isaiah had earlier used to expose
the deadness of idols is here used to expose the deadness of
Israel! Distant prediction and sudden fulfilment both deprived
them of a chance to give credit to their idols.
Stubborn (qaseh, 4): ‘brusque’ (1 Sa. 20:10), ‘cantankerous’ (1
Sa. 25:3), temperamentally difficult. Neck ... iron: incapable of
submission, self-confident. Forehead ... bronze: opinionated, the
closed mind. Admit (6): to all the other charges he has levelled
against them, Isaiah here adds an unreadiness to be convinced by
the evidence. 6c-11, The new things: the glory of God. 6c-8. The ‘former
things’ (3) were kept hidden until their sudden realization, lest it
all be attributed to idols; the new things (6c) are revealed before
their fulfilment, lest Israel arrogantly claim knowledge of them
already. Devotion to idols (5) is matched by devotion to self (7).
Spiritual disloyalty (5) is matched by the wilfulness of the rebel
(8). How can the Lord possibly continue to bother his people?
Ready to misinterpret (5), refusal to allow the facts to persuade
(6ab), arrogancy that ‘knows it all’ (7), imperviousness to
revealed truth — the cardinal sin of the Lord’s people (Am. 2:4).
Treacherous (8): the identical accusation levelled against Assyria
(33:1). Israel, with a vocation to make the world like itself, rather
allowed the world to squeeze it into its own mould (see on 2:14,
Sff.; Rom. 12:1—2).
9-11. What is it, then, that moves the Lord to persevere with
his so desperately undeserving people? First, he acts for my own
name's sake. His name is a summary statement (shorthand) for
what he is in himself, and within that nature there is a divine
logic at work (55:8) whereby merited wrath is restrained. But his
name is also what he has revealed himself to be, and (see 2)
“Yahweh’ (Ex. 3:15) is not only the holy God visiting judgment
(Ex. 12:12) but also the saving and redeeming God (Ex. 6:6-7;
12:13). His people play false to revelation, but he is always true
to what he has revealed through his word. Secondly, there is my praise, the praise due to me (see 11). This is illustrated in Exodus 32:12 and Numbers 14:13-14 — the abandonment of rebellious Israel would expose the Lord’s character and power to misunder- standing. Thirdly, there is the Lord’s choice (10),' see 41:8-9;
' MT reads b‘hartika, ‘I chose you’; Q* reads b°hantika, ‘I tested/refined you’. The change is minimal as far as the text is concerned. It is a question of Suitability of meaning. Since Israel’s ‘silver’ is all ‘dross’ (1:22), a refining would leave
302
ISAIAH 48:12—13
43:10; 44:1-2 (cf Dt. 4:37; 7:6-8; 10:15; 1 Ki. 11:24). Why the
Lord should so choose is a secret he has kept to himself, but his
choice is no passing whim: it is an inalterable commitment of his
will. He chose knowing exactly what his people are (8), and he
will not be diverted from his choice till he has fulfilled its intention.
Refined ... though not as silver (10): silver endures the crucible until all dross is gone. Were the Lord to deal with his people
just like that, nothing would remain (1:22). Therefore, though he
brings his people through trials, there is always a limit set: they
are never treated as they deserve, always for the fulfilment of his
purpose (Heb. 12:10). Furnace of affliction: classically this refers
to Egypt (Dt. 4:20; 1 Ki. 8:51), and (10b) he will never alter the
choice there made. In the present context the furnace could be
Babylon, and the verb ‘to choose’ could exhibit the same
meaning as in 14:1 and Zechariah 1:17, ‘to renew choice’. Glory
to another: if Israel’s sinfulness defeats the Lord’s purposes, then
sin gets glory over him; if the people remain in exile, then the
gods of Babylon triumph. But neither the forces of history
(Babylon) nor the power of sin will win the day.
12-16, The all-controlling Lord. Verse 12a repeats 1 and
indicates that we are now entering the second half of the poem.
The repeated calls to Jisten (12a, 14a, 16a) mark the divisions of
this section: the Lord controls the whole universe (12-13), he
controls history, bringing on to the scene the one he has chosen to
fulfil his purpose (14~-15), and he controls the advent of his
Servant endowed for his task (16).
12-13. Called: note the same verb in verse 1, exposing Israel’s
gross unfaithfulness. But their unfaithfulness does not nullify the
faithfulness of God: they denied their calling; he affirms his
calling of them. J am he: he is the unchanged, unchanging God.
Summon (13) is, again, the verb ‘to call’. By his ‘calling’, he
masters the whole universe and gives it stability and continuance.
Stand up: ‘stand in their position’. This sovereignty of the divine
‘calling’ proves that the calling of Israel cannot fail of its purpose
either. As first the Lord was not under any external compulsion to
do what he did (either in the creation of the world or in the
calling of Israel); as /ast he stands at the end unchallenged by any
force that might have tried to oppose him, bringing to triumphant
conclusion (for the world and for Israel) what he started (Phil.
1:6).
nothing. But to say that, when this particular silver was in the ‘furnace’, the Lord
‘chose’ to set a limit to the process and ‘renew his choice’ is exact.
303
ISAIAH 48:14-16
14-15. The focus then narrows from the universal (13) to the
particular (14), and moves from creation to history. The Lord is
different from all gods in that he predicts and fulfils (14ab); his
Cyrus plan will succeed against Babylon (14cd); the calling of
God is the governing factor in history (15ab); and in this the Lord
is not a remote deity but one working his purpose out in the
details of the historical process (15cd). Thus he is both over and
in history: its movements begin in his mind (14ab), he determines
the powers that arise and the purposes they will achieve (14cd),
and having spoken the determinative word (15ab) he personally superintends its fulfilment (15cd). The word of God (14ab, 15)
brackets the history of the world. The argument from prediction and fulfilment has been used to
challenge the idols (e.g. 41:21-24) and to recall Israel to true
faith (48:6). It is used here in verse 14 rather to reassure the
people of God in the light of the Cyrus plan about which they
have such misgivings (45:9-10; 46:8, 12). The Lord himself is
behind it, and all must therefore be well. The LORD’s chosen ally
will ... (14): literally ‘The-Lord-loves-him will perform ...’,
where the hyphenated phrase becomes as it were a title. It is an
interesting anticipation of what the Cyrus Cylinder says about
Marduk, that ‘he called Cyrus ... went at his side like a friend ...’
But Marduk was wise only after the event and, even so, said
nothing about Babylon and how it would fare. Isaiah predicts
how a greater ‘friend’ planned and superintended Cyrus from
inception to climax. Called (15): cf: 12-13 (summon). The
sovereign call of God is the dominant factor within the covenant
(12), over creation (13) and in world events (15).
16. Once more the word of God is the initial and initiating
factor, now seen in the sending of an unnamed speaker. We are
told, however, that he is sent by the Sovereign LORD (‘“donay
yahweh) and (endowed) with his Spirit. The only Spirit-endowed
person in these chapters is the Servant (42:1), and in the
immediate context the divine designation ‘Lord Yahweh’ occurs
in the third Servant Song as endowing (50:4), directing (50:5)
and helping (50:7) the Servant. In addition, when the Servant reappears in chapters 56 — 66 as the Conqueror, 61:1 opens with the Spirit of the Sovereign LORD is upon me.' We can hardly question, then, that the present verse is an interjection by the Servant of the Lord as the Agent of the ‘new things’ announced in the matching verses 3-6b. The balance of the passages is a
‘Isaiah mentions the enduement of the Spirit nine times QU123021 32515: 42:1; 44:3; 48:16; 59:21; 61:1; 63:11). Of these, five relate to the Messiah.
304
ISAIAH 48:17
striking illustration of the way structure aids interpretation:
former things (3-6b), new things (6c—7); Cyrus (14-15), the
Servant (16). While the interjection does, of course, take us by
Surprise, it is far from inappropriate that the Servant should step
from the shadows like this. First, it suits what has immediately
preceded. The Lord is the sovereign ruler of creation (13); his
rule of the flow of history is signally seen in Cyrus (14-15); but
the Servant, as revealed by Isaiah, is the climax to which all
history is leading. Secondly, it is appropriate to what follows:
with 48:20-21 the significance of Cyrus has ended. But, for the
problem raised by verse 22, the Servant is the appointed answer.
As the one actor leaves the stage, the other quietly reveals his presence.
17-22, A problem solved; a problem raised. The thought of
peace enfolds these verses, the peace that might have been (17—
19) and the peace that cannot be (22). In between there is the
great exit from Babylon (20) and the exodus-like journey home
(21). The political solution — the people home from Babylon —
does not recover the peace that might have been. It was the sin of
disobedience (18) that forfeited peace, and until wickedness has
been dealt with peace must remain unrealized.
17. Redeemer (47:4): as their Next-of-Kin the Lord has taken
on himself their need of liberation. His almighty power has
directed history in the rousing of Cyrus, the conqueror-liberator.
The Holy One of Israel: in chapters 40 — 55 Isaiah calls the Lord
‘Redeemer’ ten times, and in six of these he links the Lord’s
next-of-kinship, as here, with the title the Holy One of Israel
(41:14; 43:14; 47:4; 49:7; 54:5). That the Holy One should draw
near as the Next-of-Kin is a truly overwhelming display of grace
and condescension, but it raises in a crucial form the problem not
only of unworthiness but of sin. Can the Next-of-Kin shoulder
this problem also? Surely it is for this reason that Isaiah so insists
on holding the two concepts together. Whatever help he brings to
his people (41:8), whatever rescue he effects (43:14), whatever
victory he wins (47:4) — whatever burden he takes from them
and loads on to himself — he remains the Holy One. Sooner or
later the disparity between his holiness and their unworthy sinfulness much be taken into account. In this way Isaiah prepares
for the stark announcement in verse 22 and for the ensuing
spiritual redemption through the Servant. Teaches ... directs:
the Lord ministers to his people through the word he speaks.
This is their distinguishing privilege: to possess the revealed
word. It is, first, a divine address to the mind (‘teach’), and then,
secondly, through the mind to the will (‘direct’), and finally, in
305
ISAIAH 48:18—21
the life of obedience, it is best for you, the way of the highest
ood.
: 18-19. These verses develop the leading thought of 17, the
word of God, the way of blessing, but they do so wistfully,
recalling what might have been. Obedience promises, first, peace,
all-round well-being — Godward, manward, selfward (9:6; 26:3,
12; 32:17) — and that peace is as a constant, full reality, a river
(66:12), not a seasonal stream; and, secondly, righteousness, here
a life conformed to what is right before God. Waves often picture
overwhelming power (Ps. 42:7; 65:7; 107:25), and that is probably the thought here: a life impervious to the threat of opposed
forces, a steady, consistent righteousness of life. Thirdly, by obedience, the Lord’s people enter into his covenant blessings:
descendants... like the sand (Gn. 15:5; 22:17), including the
particular blessing (noted in Pr. 20:7) of the prevalence of
godliness through the generations. The fourth blessing
consequent upon obedience is perpetuity in the favour of God:
name ... never cut off. It is not, of course, that our obedience
earns the blessing of eternal security, but that the obedient life is
proof of the reality of our standing before God (Jn. 15:7—8; 1 Jn.
2:3-6).
20-21. In spite of the record of failure in verses 17-18, the
mercy of God prevails in the call to exit from Babylon into the
caring blessings of a new exodus. Leave (lit. ‘go out’) and flee are
both exodus verbs (e.g. Ex. 12:41; 13:3; 14:5). They are used
here not to express any danger from which flight is needed but to
begin to create the picture of another exodus. The fact that the
historical return (Ezr. 1 — 2) was numerically meagre does not
minimize it as a mighty, exodus-like act of God: the rousing and
bringing of Cyrus, the marvel of a conqueror turned liberator, the
blessedness of a promise fulfilled (Je. 25:12-13; 29:10; with Ezr.
1:1). The people’s failure to enter worthily into the Lord’s opened
door should not surprise us in the light of verses 17-18, nor
should we allow it to reduce for us the magnitude of what he did
to the poor dimensions of their response. Announce ... shout (20): had they responded worthily and obediently, their liberation could have been a witness to the world. It was, in fact, an event of world proportions, though they did not see it as such. Redeemed: taken upon himself the burden of their need and met it. Thirst ... rock (21): this is a broad recollection of a journey that never lacked divine provision (Dt. 8:14), but Exodus 17:1—7 is carefully chosen, for it was also an example of divine care for a grumbling people — just as here they are blessed by the Lord’s Cyrus plan against which they had groused (45:9-10; 46:8ff.).
306
ISAIAH 48:22
22.' A change of scene does not produce a change of heart.
Leaving Babylon, they do not leave behind their characters and
characteristics. They are the people of verses 17-18, who have
left the way of peace. Wicked is a broad word, an apt summary of
the charges levelled against Israel in this chapter. It writes an
epitaph to the Babylonian experience. They went because of sin
(42:18-25); they stayed without moral reform or even the
recognition of need; they return as they went. They come back to
Canaan, but they still need to be brought back to the Lord.
IX. THE GREATER DELIVERANCE:
THE WORK OF THE SERVANT (49 — 55)
The emphasis on the sinfulness of Israel (48:1—8), the unexpected
interjection from the Servant (48:16), and the assertion that the
people have come back from Babylon but still need to be brought
back to the Lord (48:22), prepare us for chapters 49 — 55, the
redeeming work of the Servant. He is given a double task relating
to Israel and to the world (49:56), and when he has performed
the great work of sin-bearing (52:13 — 53:12) the call goes out to
Zion (54:1 ff.) and the world (55:1ff.) to enter gladly and freely
into what he has done.
a. The Servant’s double task (49:1-6)
Isaiah 49:1—6, the second Servant Song, has the same relationship
to 48:1-22 as the first Servant Song (42:1-4) has to what precedes it. There, the mounting awareness of Gentile need (41:21—
29) was answered by the announcement that the Lord had a
Servant at the ready who would bring justice — divine revelation
— to the helpless and hopeless world (42:1, 3-4). Following this a
new factor entered the equation. Israel, the ‘official’ servant of
the Lord (41:8), bound, blind and sinful (42:18—25), was unfit for
the task, and Isaiah’s awareness of Israel’s need came to
dominate his presentation, reaching its climax in 48:1 ff. This is
the cue for the Servant once more to occupy centre stage as he
testifies to his prior call to bring Jacob back to him ... to bring
back ... Israel (49:5-6) while also bringing salvation to the ends
1 Commentators wonder if these words are original to the text. F. Delitzsch
(Commentary on Isaiah [T. & T. Clark, 1873]) and Young (Studies in Isaiah) note
their meaning but do not explain their position here. Kissane (The Book of Isaiah)
observes the same words in 57:21 where he believes them to be in place, but
reckons them misplaced here. Whybray (Isaiah 40 — 66) wonders if both
occurrences may be editorial markers dividing the text into sections, but he does
not offer an analysis to support this.
307
ISAIAH 49: 1-3
of the earth (49:6). The Servant’s job description has been reeet he is still committed to the whole world as in 42:14, but
now, conforming to the development in 42:18 — 48:22, he has
a prior task in relation to Israel. His testimony falls into two
parts.
i. The first testimony: Israel as it was meant to be (49:1-3).
lab is a summons to the world in all its extent (islands; 11:11;
24:15; 41:1; 42:4, 10, 12) and all its peoples (/°ummim, a general
word possibly emphasizing the human element ). Thus the testimony starts as it will end (6) on a universal scale, a message (1)
and a ministry (6) to all humankind. Listen to me: the prophets
are extremely sparing in worldwide address (41;1; Je. 31:10) but
neither Jeremiah (though called to a worldwide ministry, 1:5) nor
any other prophet ever said, ‘Listen to me’, just like this. Only
Isaiah uses to me, and then only of the Lord (46:3, 12; 48:12;
51:1, 7; 55:2; cf 41:1). How then can the Servant thus address
the world? His demand for a worldwide hearing, based on the qualifications listed in verses 1c—3, is as absolute as ‘Listen to
him’ in Mark 9:7. At the very least he is no ‘mere’ prophet!
1c—3. The Servant justifies his call to the world by his position
(1cd), his preparation (2) and his person (3). There are eight
paired lines, carefully balanced: the first line in each pair (called
. mouth ... arrow ... servant) is about service: calling,
preparation, effectiveness, status; the second line (name ...
shadow ... quiver ... Israel) is about personal identity and
secrecy. Born ... birth: literally ‘from/in the womb ... from my
mother’s body’. The Servant is truly human and is not a divine
afterthought. Nevertheless, as a prophet of the Lord (Je. 1:5), he
is truly special. In respect of the Messiah there is often this sort
of reference to his mother: 7:14; Genesis 3:15; Psalm 22:9-10;
Micah 5:2 and possibly the enigmatic Jeremiah 31:22. Called
(Vgara’) is not used of ‘calling’ a prophet but is used of the Lord
making a sovereign appointment (e.g. 40:26 [stars]; 41:4; 44:7,
NIV ‘proclaim’ [events in history]), specifically of Israel (41:7;
43:1), Cyrus (41:2; 45:3-4; 46:11; 48:15) and the Servant (42:6). The thought, then, is not of a ‘calling’ to be a prophet but of sovereign conscription to a special status and function. Mouth (2): the Servant has a prophetic task. The sharpness of a sword makes it effective. Cyrus had an effective sword (41:2), but the sword of the Servant is of a different nature: the imagery of war used in the interests of the gospel of peace (9:1—7; 11:11-16; cf, Heb. 4:12; Rev. 1:16; 19:15). Polished arrow: the shaft of an arrow was rubbed down to make it aerodynamic and free it from
308
ISAIAH 49:4
roughness which would deflect its flight. The contrast between
the sword for close encounters and the arrow for distant attack
implies that the Servant is equipped for every contest. Quiver:
under the personal care of the Lord’s hand, the Servant is also
reserved for the specific target the Lord intends. Servant, Israel:
Israel was the name of an individual before it became that of a
nation, and with the name came responsibility for the Abrahamic
promises of world blessing (Gn. 28:13—14; 35:9-15). The whole
weight rested on the shoulders of one individual. Isaiah now
brings that responsibility full circle. He has discerned that the
nation-servant is unfit (42:18-25) — indeed, so unfit that it can no
longer claim the name (48:1—2). So, must the Lord admit defeat?
No, he has prepared a worthy Israel! — the Servant divinely
shaped for the task and, as we shall soon discover (49:14 —
50:11), the only one worthy of the name.’ Display my splendour
(lit. ‘beauty’) occurs thirteen times in the Old Testament, of
which nine are in Isaiah. On all other occasions the Lord shows
his beauty by what he himself does (44:23; 60:21), but here it is
by what is done for him. Elsewhere the plural is used of those in
whom the Lord shows his beauty; here it is just the Servant. This
is never said to any individual, to Israel or any group within
Israel: Isaiah says a unique thing about one whom he sees as a
unique person.
ii. The second testimony: the Agent, the task and the result
(49:46). The despondent Servant (4) becomes the Servant
buoyant regarding his primary task (5) and divinely assured in
regard to his ultimate objective (6).
4. Laboured ... no purpose; spent ... in vain: no effort has
been spared; no good has been achieved. If the servant is to be
identified with Jesus Christ, we cannot but ask where, in him, do
we find this darkness? Gethsemane does not suit, for there the
darkness sprang from the impending future. But throughout the
Gospels Jesus faced rejection, unbelief, prejudice and misunderstanding. He cried out, ‘How long ...?’ (Lk. 9:41), was grieved
1 Commentators either find the attribution of the name ‘Israel’ to the servant
so inexplicable that they excise it (Smart), or else, on the general pattern set by
Skinner, try to use it to identify the Servant with the nation or with the ‘true’
Israel, the remnant within the nation. See Introduction, pp. 26-27. One MS
(Kennicott 96) lacks the word ‘Israel’, but it is infamous for its variants and no
importance can be attached to this omission (Rowley, The Servant of the Lord, p.
8). C. R. North notes that ‘even if K 96 were a good MS we should hardly be
justified in following it in defiance of the otherwise unanimous textual evidence’
(Second Isaiah [OUP, 1964], p. 187).
309
ISAIAH 49:5-6
by his disciples’ failure to understand (Mk. 8:21), and foresaw the
falling away of the core group (Mk. 14:27). Perhaps what is thus
diffused throughout Jesus’ ministry is, so to speak, compressed
by Isaiah into this single utterance. Yet (’akén): ‘But indeed’, a
conjunction emphatically countering what has preceded. When
despair threatens, there is an antidote. Due to me corresponds to
the despondency which says, ‘I am a failure.’ Literally, ‘my judgment is with the Lord’. It is for the Lord to decide whether I
am a failure or not. All I can do is labour and spend my strength,
beyond that it is for him to judge. My reward corresponds to the
other side of despondency: ‘Nothing has been achieved.’ But this
too is the Lord’s business; it is for him to ‘give the increase’ (1
Cor. 3:7-9; cf, AV). The answer to despondency is to look to God, acknowledge his sovereignty and rest trustfully in him to perform
his perfect will. But notice that Isaiah foresaw a truly human
Servant, tested, and himself testing the way of faith, but still
saying my God when everything seems fo no purpose, ‘empty’ (in
vain; tohi), without sense or meaning, and for nothing (hebel),
without substance or solidity, evanescent.
5. This verse begins with the Servant’s (fresh?) awareness of
the way the hand of God has been upon him (Sab), and ends with
his sense of his dignity before God (Se) and of new spiritual
vitality (6—7). In this he admits us to another secret in relation to
despondency: work to which God has called can never be a
failure; the one who obeys the call has a rich dignity before God
and an unfailing strength. Jn the womb is identical with verse 1c
and notes that every single experience of life from conception
onwards has been a sharpening of the sword and a polishing of
the arrow (2). So it is with every servant of the Lord, therefore
there is no room for despondency: ‘The work which His
goodness began/The arm of His strength will complete.’! Jo
bring Jacob back to him: the task for which the Servant is
renewed is the restoration to the Lord of Jacob ... Israel,’ the
spiritual counterpart of the restoration from Babylon (48:20-22), the fulfilment of the pledge made in 43:22 — 44:23. Has been my strength, i.e. all along, even when obscured by the darkness of despondency.
6. This Servant Israel (3) is, first, distinct from the nation
' From A. Toplady, ‘A debtor to mercy alone’. Cf. Phil. 1:6. 2 Gather Israel to himself is a place where there is tension between 16 ” (‘not’) — and /6 (‘to him’). Cf 9:3. ‘And that Israel be not Swept away’ is possible in ers but the Masoretes (now supported by Q*) recommended the more suitable ‘to him’, :
310
ISAIAH 49:7
Israel, for it is his task to bring the people back: the nation cannot
be its own saviour from sin. Secondly, he is the true and only
Israel, for he is going to do what Israel was always meant to do
(cf 2:2-4) — gather from the whole world. Those of Israel I have
kept:' 4:3 describes ‘those who are left in Zion’ as (lit.) ‘written
unto life’, that is to say, destined in advance by the Lord for the
promised cleansing (4:4). In the same sense, then, it is the
Servant’s task to bring to the Lord, not all who claim the name
Israel, but those whom the Lord has ‘kept’ with that intention in
mind. Light ... salvation: the Servant in his own person is the
Light of the world (cf 42:14, 5-9). We should translate ‘that
you may be my salvation’. Thus ‘you are my servant’ (3) is
balanced by ‘you are my salvation’. Just as the world will find
him to be the light they need, so he is the salvation they need.
This task runs beyond what any prophet or any mere human
could fulfil.
b. Divine confirmation: worldwide success (49:7—13)
The first Servant Song (42:1-4) set a pattern which each in turn
repeats — the addition of a confirmatory ‘tailpiece’ (see 42:5—9):
here, his significance for the whole world is divinely confirmed
as the Lord forecasts Gentile submission to the Servant (7),
balancing this with a covenant for a restored Israel (8); Israel’s
exodus journey home (9-10) is then balanced by a worldwide
ingathering (11-12) and the call to universal praise (13). What
the Servant is called to do (1-6) is guaranteed by the divine word
(7-13).
7. Israel (lines b and h) refers to the Servant. Throughout
chapters 49 — 55 the nation is called Zion — following the
contention in 48:1 and because it has lost the right to the name
which has passed to the Servant (3). In the full reality of his
divine nature (Holy One) the Lord stands as Next-of-Kin
(Redeemer) to meet his Servant’s every need and guarantee his
success. Isaiah is aware that the Servant will be despised by his
own nation and dominated (servant) by the world (rulers ...
kings), but the faithful Next-of-Kin will bring his Servant through
to the point where kings will ... rise up and princes ... bow down.
The contrasting actions of rising and bowing indicate total
respectful acknowledgment.
1 There is a slight textual uncertainty here. The word in the text (nasir) is not
found elsewhere, though it would be a respectably formed passive noun,
‘preserved one’. MT recommends reading ndsur, a passive participle with the
same meaning.
311
ISAIAH 49.813
8-9b. The reference to people, land and inheritances shows
that the topic is now what the Servant will do for the Lord’s
professing people. Through prayer (8b), as covenant man (8d), he
will bring a fourfold blessing: restoration (8f), possession (8g),
liberation (9a) and transformation (9b). Salvation includes ‘when
you need my delivering action’ — picturing the Servant as under
duress — as well as the wider meaning of what the Servant will
accomplish for others. Be a covenant: he will be the covenant in
his own person, that is to say it is only in him, in union with him,
that the covenant blessings can be enjoyed. Reassign: literally
‘cause to inherit/to possess’, ie. bring into actual, secure possession. Isaiah sees the future in terms which come naturally
to him. In the light of John 18:36 and Acts 15:15—18 we see that
land, restoration, captives and darkness are all figurative of spiritual blessings.
9c-10. As the exodus from Egypt led to a journey under God’s
care, so in this journey of the heart back to the Lord there is
provision (9cd), with pasturage beside the roads, i.e. readily
available, and the barren become fertile; protection (10ab) from
the inner weakness of hunger and thirst and the outward threat of
heat and sun (heat translates sarab, which may possibly mean
‘mirage’ — in context, the threat of disappointment); and guardianship (10cd), as the journey is under divine superintendence.
The Lord has taken the people to his heart in compassion
(Vraham, a love that is both maternal [1 Ki. 3:26] and paternal |
[Ps. 103:13]), under his care (guide ... lead), and into his bounty
(springs of water).
11-12. Nothing is allowed to stand in the way of the worldwide ingathering: mountains, blocking the way, become roads.
No-one can get lost: highways, raised above the surrounding
countryside, cannot be missed. Neither distance (afar) nor dispersion (north ... west) can stop them, nor can strangeness of
location: Aswan is only a guess at the original sinim.' It is most
likely that Isaiah was being consciously obscure. Even unmapped
places are known to God, and even from them he will gather his pilgrims.
13. Heavens and earth are the contrasting realities that make up the totality. Mountains are perhaps singled out as places from which good tidings were shouted (40:9), or possibly as typical of
1 ‘Sinim’, NIV mg., is unknown to us. ‘Aswan’ is only a guess (cf. Ezk. 29:10; 30:6). Q® reads swnyym which, again, might be Aswan, but more likely Q* was Lar as much guessing as we are. The identification of Sinim with China lacks evidence.
312
ISAIAH 49:14-16
the solid earth itself, once corrupted by human sin and now
liberated in the liberation of the children of God (Rom. 8:20-21).
Shout ... rejoice ... song: singing expresses entering responsively
into what the Lord has accomplished and to which his people
contribute nothing (12:1; 24:16; 25:1; 30:39; 54:1). The Lord has
done it; all they do is sing! His people: just as in 45:17 and 25 the
context required that Jsrael should cover the worldwide gathered
people, so here his people are all those embraced by the work of
the Servant (S—6, 7-12). Afflicted: the downtrodden, pointing in
the present context to their spiritual need and helplessness. Comforts is what the Lord does, compassion (see 10) is what he feels.
c. Nation and Servant, a contrast: unresponding and
responding (49:14 — 50:11)
The voice of complaint (14) is a tragic anticlimax after the
exuberance of 13, but it sets the tone for the next stage in Isaiah’s
argument. Ruined, broken Zion, desolate after its long years of
emptiness, offers an apt picture of the people themselves — just as
we met them in 40:27; 45:9-11; 46:8-12, despondent, defeatist
and grumbling. But, while they prefer their misery to the Lord’s
promises (49:14 — 50:3), the Servant again speaks in responsive,
trustful obedience (50:4~-9). In 42:18-—25 Israel’s unworthiness
unfitted it to be the Lord’s Servant; now the Servant’s contrasting
worthiness qualifies him for the office. On the one hand, Zion is
offered inducements to trust (49:14—26) but will not; on the other
hand the Servant is forewarned of suffering to come (50:5, 6) yet
responds with commitment. The contrast between the Servant
who is Israel (49:3) and Zion who used to be Israel (48:1—2) is
striking. Yet the Lord does not give up on his people but seeks to
win them to faith by his rich promises.
The promise of unforgetfulness (49:14-16). 14. Forsaken ...
forgotten correspond to ‘out of sight, out of mind’. The LORD
(Yahweh) is the God who chose and redeemed his captive people
in Egypt (Ex. 3:15): can he forget his captives now? The Lord
(‘“donay) is the Sovereign One who can be neither compelled nor
prohibited. 15-16. Mother and infant are bound by ties of dependence (at
her breast) and life (child she has borne, lit. ‘son of her body’),
yet even this relationship can fail, but not the Lord. J is emphatic,
“but as for me’. The Lord’s unforgetting love transcends even
earth’s best. See suggests a gesture, the hands held out for
inspection, incised with self-inflicted wounds of love. Your walls
are either the ruined walls in their mute appeal (Ps. 74:3; 102:13-
14) or perhaps the Lord’s blueprint of the new Jerusalem.
313
ISAIAH 49:17-24
The promise of increase (49:17-20). The gathering family’
is, in earthly terms, the supreme cordial for parental gloom. —
17. Laid you waste is two verbs in the Hebrew, ‘demolished
you and left you waste’, as if the Lord would assure poor Zion
that he understands how awful was the process of demolition and
the resultant desolation.
18-20. There are three aspects of promised transformation: the
despondent mother given a fresh start in joy like a bride (18), the
empty city filled and free of threat (19) and the new inhabitants
positive and forward-looking (20).
The promise of world dominion (49:21—23). Zion’s question
is also ours: what is this ingathering and increase that the prophet
promises (20)? How will it happen? It is not any natural
development (21) but an act of God (23ef) on a worldwide scale,
involving the subservience of the world to the interests of the
Lord’s people (22—23d). Behind it lies the messianic banner of
11:12, the Jubilee of 27:12—13 and the world vision of 44:14—25.
The explanation of transformed barrenness will come in 54:1—17.
Isaiah is using the imagery of the ruined city, the captive exile,
the barren woman and the worldwide reunion but, against the
background of 49:1-6, 7-13, the transformation is the fruit of the
work of the servant, people and world brought back to God.
21. Bereaved and barren: doubly infertile, husbandless and
sterile. Exiled and rejected: ‘captive and evicted / dismissed’, now
belonging to others, rejected by her own.
22-23. Beckon: ‘lift my hand’. Divine sovereignty is such that
a mere gesture is enough. Gentiles (lit. ‘nations’) ... peoples ...
kings ... queens: whether in its massed organization or in the persons of its great ones, the world is at the Lord’s beck and call to
serve the circumstantial (bring ... carry) or personal (foster ...
nursing) needs of Zion’s children and to do so with true subservience (bow ... lick). As in 45:14 the picture of servility
emphasizes a spiritual truth, that those who would join the Lord’s
people must first submit to them (1 Cor. 14:25). The imagery is
political subservience, the reality is spiritual indebtedness. Hope
is ‘wait for (with trustful expectancy)’ (40:31). The promise of deliverance (49:24-26). 24. Calling Zion’s
children home involves, first, breaking the powers which hold
, lIn verse 17, MT reads banayi', ‘your sons’, but many prefer Q*, bénay7’, your builders’, as offering a good contrast with ‘those who laid you waste’. The true contrast, however, is between those who banished the sons and the return of the sons, marking the end of the rule of the destroyers. The theme of sons is central to the section. f
314
ISAIAH 49:25 — 50:1
them (plunder ... from warriors, 24), but there is something else
as well: fierce is an emended text;' MT has ‘righteous’ — that is to
say, delivering captives requires not only the strength to do so but
also the legal right. Suppose they are lawfully held prisoner? If
the captor has a right to his prisoners, can that right be denied?
25. Both questions in verse 24 are answered: warriors — even
fierce ones — must submit to superior power; furthermore the
Lord proposes to take to law those who claim a legal right to his
people: contend is here used in its forensic meaning, ‘to plead a
case’. The Lord’s almighty power is sufficient against any foe but
he will never use that power except in accordance with the claims
of law (45:21; 53:11; 54:14, 17; Rom. 3:26), violating neither his
aE eames character nor the rights even of his foes (Gn.
26. The pictures of eating their own flesh and drinking their
own blood draw on the horrors of siege conditions. The reality is
that those who oppose the Lord and his people experience the
self-destructiveness of sin — a recurring feature of the wars of the
Lord (Jdg. 7:22; 1 Sa. 14:20; 2 Ch. 20:23-24). This will constitute a worldwide revelation (all ... will know) of the Lord as
Yahweh (LORD) — who, as in Egypt, delivers his people and
overthrows his enemies; as Saviour (Vyasa‘, 25:9); as Redeemer,
or Next-of-Kin (35:9-10); and as Mighty One of Jacob. Mighty
focuses exclusively on the attribute of power, the absolute
strength of the Lord wedded to the welfare of his unworthy
Jacob.
The promise of ransom (50:1-3). 1. Isaiah pursues the
question of legality, raised in 49:24—25. He offers two pictures:
divorce and slavery. According to Deuteronomy 24:1+4, a
divorce could initiate a series of events making reconstitution of
the original marriage impossible. The absence here of a certificate shows that this process has not even started. As to slavery, in
default of payment, a creditor was legally entitled to enslave the
debtor’s dependants (Ex. 21:7; 2 Ki. 4:1ff.; Ne. 5:1-5), and, as
long as this situation obtained, all rights lay with the creditor,
none with the debtor. In both cases there were legal requirements
to be met. But are these situations applicable? Divorce accuses unfailing love of failure; slavery accuses sovereign power of
weakness and sovereign resources of inadequacy. The truth, however, is very different, for it was all a matter of due reward of sins
(‘awon, 1f), inner perversion of heart (6:7), and transgressions
1 The alteration of zaddiq (‘righteous’) to ‘aris, following Q*, is commonplace, but can be made only at the expense of doctrinal fullness.
515
ISAIAH 50:2-4
(pesa‘, 1g) , ‘wilful rebellion’. Sold: cf Judges 231453 6425
10:7. 2-3. Why ... no-one? Since neither divorce nor slavery
explains the banishment of Zion, they cannot plead irretrievable
breakdown or legal barriers; they cannot justify self-pitying despondency. If the Lord chooses to call them back to himself he can
do so — he is the offended party, not they! So why no response?
The wording is very emphatic — ‘not a single individual ... noone at all’ — and provides a telling contrast with (4) the single
responsive voice of the Servant. Arm ... short is (lit.) ‘hand ...
short’. The idea of the ‘short hand’ occurs in 59:1 (see Nu. 11:23)
and is related to the use of ‘hand’ meaning (financial) resources
(Lv. 5:7, cannot afford = ‘hand cannot reach’; 12:8; 14:21). The
verb to ransom involves ‘paying the price’ (1:27; 35:10) required
to obtain freedom. The question therefore indignantly asks
whether the Lord is short of the cash to buy back his wife (Ho.
3:2), to redeem his slaves or to find the due payment for their sins
— in short: can the Lord satisfy the law? The next question asks if
he has the power fo rescue (lit. ‘to deliver’, i.e. from the grasp of
a captor), and it is answered by an appeal to the evidence of the
creation (2e-3; cf Am. 4:13; 5:8-9; 9:5-6). The Lord’s power
over creation demonstrates his ability to do whatever he wills, promises or threatens. In particular he can effect dramatic change
on earth (2ef; Ps. 106:9), among living things (2gh; Ex. 7:17—
18) and in the sky above (3; Ex. 10:21—23). Isaiah chooses
illustrations of divine power which also illustrate the Lord’s interventions to save, power on behalf of his people against their oppressors. To fail to respond to such a God is without excuse.
Obedient Israel: the responsive Servant (50:4—9). (On this
section, see further on 53:7-9.) A new voice cuts across the
Lord’s indignant expostulations (2-3). Contradicting the ‘no-one
at all’ of verse 2, there is one who testifies to listening and responding (5). The speaker uses the first person but does not
identify himself, and it is not until the ‘tailpiece’ (10-11) that we learn we have been listening to the Servant. Arising from the easily overlooked clue in 49:7 that the Servant is a sufferer (‘despised and abhorred’) and subordinated, deeply personal suf- ferings are described and traced back to their cause in resolute obedience to the Lord. Four times the Sovereign LORD — Yahweh, the saving God in all his absolute power — is given the emphatic position (4, 5, 7, 9) and divides the testimony into its component parts.
_4. By gift of the Sovereign LorD he has an instructed tongue, (lit.) “a tongue of those who have been /are being taught’: in short
316
ISAIAH 50:5-6
4 disciples tongue’. The same word (/immiidim) is translated
‘disciples’ in 8:16. And, because he has been discipled by the
Lord in how to speak and what to say, he is able to exercise an
effective spoken ministry: to know the word that sustains. The
verb translated sustains (V‘ait) is not found elsewhere. Suggestions include ‘to incline towards = to console’, ‘to respond (to
needs)’; emendations include ‘to shepherd’ and ‘to care for’, but
the oldest suggestion is still possible, relating the verb to the
noun ‘éf, ‘a timely moment, a season’, hence ‘to be seasonable’,
xo speek a word in season .' This emphasizes the ‘prophetic’ role
of the Servant, prominent throughout (42:2; 49:2; 53:9). Weary:
‘fainting’ under life’s demands. In verse 4cd we move from the
word spoken to the word heard. The connection is not spelled out
but is obvious: only those who hear the word can share it. He testifies of an experience (he wakens), a time (morning), a regularity (morning by morning), an objective (my ear to listen, lit.
‘hear’) and a characteristic (like one, lit. ‘those’, who is being
taught, or ‘like disciples’). It is the Lord who takes the initiative,
rousing his Servant for the morning fellowship; the word of God
is central to it; the objective is to convey truth through the ear to
the mind — and this is the essence of what it means to be a
disciple: the ‘morning watch’ is not a special provision for a
unique Servant; it is the standard curriculum for all who would be
disciples.
5-6. In the morning by morning discipleship the Servant
learned the Lord’s will. It was in one such session that the Lord
opened my ears (lit. ‘ear’). The following not rebellious indicates
what was revealed: what the Lord wanted him to do and be. It was an issue of obedience, in which he was not rebellious.
Drawn back: literally ‘slip away backwards’, take evasive action.
In other words, the revelation he received was one that made
demands from which there would be a natural tendency to ‘back
off’. Already therefore he is exhibiting the resoluteness which
will reappear in verse 7, and for this reason we could well translate the following verbs as ‘perfects of resolve’: when the will of
God was revealed ‘I resolved to give my back ... not to hide ...’.
There was a forewarning of hardship to come, and it was bravely
faced, resolutely accepted and perseveringly carried through:
1 From a linguistic point of view, V‘it is most reasonably related to “et, a
‘season’. North (Second Isaiah) reports a possible meaning arising from Arabic,
‘to console’. Instead of /a‘iit, BHS prefers the emendation Jir*‘ot, ‘to shepherd’.
C. C. Torrey thought that /a‘it was a mistaken reduplication of the immediately
preceding /ada‘at (‘to know’), but from an identically spelt verb, ‘to care for’
(Second Isaiah [T. & T. Clark, 1928)).

pad MTR TEIN BERT ST upon obedience (5-6), now
accompanies to help. The Servant’s awareness of this divine help
(7a) strengthens him to believe he can do it (7b), to set himself to

his side and the Lord will be his advocate (8). Disgraced ...

‘resolutely set out’ (lit. ‘set his face’), and 9:53, ‘he was heading’
(lit. ‘his face was’). Vindicates: in 45:21 and 49:24—25, it was
emphasized that the sanctity of the law must be preserved. Here,
therefore, the conflict between the Servant and his oppressors is
pictured as a court scene. Whatever he has been called to by the
Lord (5), whatever it is that involves such suffering (6) and
requires such resoluteness (7) must satisfy all legal requirements.
Near (8) is parallel in use to go’él, Redeemer, the Next-of-Kin
(Lv. 21:2—3; 25:25; Nu. 27:11; Ru. 2:20; 3:12). Charges against
me: the Servant is himself in the dock, but he is confident that
whatever charges are made (8b) or whoever makes them (8d),
they cannot be made out (Mt. 27:34, 19, 24; Mk. 15:3; Lk. 23:4,
10, 14-15, 41; Jn. 8:46; 19:6).
9. The law-court setting continues but the emphasis changes:
just as the Servant was confident (8) of gaining the verdict, so he
is confident (9) of the rout of his opponents. Since God is on his
side, who can be against him? — but not as a matter of favouritism
or of superior power as such, but because no condemnation
can be sustained against him. Condemn means ‘prove me guilty’.
Internal factors (wear out) and external forces (moths) will expose the transience of his accusers.
The Servant, exemplary and decisive (50:10—-11). The
‘tailpieces’ of the first two Servant Songs (42:5-9; 49:7-13)
confirmed aspects of the Servant’s task; the present and final ‘tailpieces’ (54:1 — 55:13) are appeals to respond to the Servant. The uniting idea of these verses is Jight (10d, 11c). There are two sorts of people: the one sort (10) has no light but obeys the word of the Lord’s Servant by facing the darkness with trust and reliance. The others (11) seek to conquer the darkness by fires of their own making. The outcome for the first is not specified; the others suffer an adverse divine reaction (lle) and lie down in torment (11f). The perfection of the One against whom no charge
318
ISAIAH 50:10-11
can be made (8) makes him our model (10); the fate of his
accusers (9) is shared by those who refuse his way (11). Just as
he lived in obedience (5), trust and reliance (7, 9) so do those
who model themselves on him (10).
10-11. Fears the LorD and obeys ... his servant are in parallel.
The way to reverence the Lord is to obey the Servant. Dark ... no
light: as for him, the way of obedience (5-6) brings days of
darkness. Just as he is the model, so his experiences are the norm.
Rely: ‘lean’. It is not simply (11) that those who opt for a do-ityourself approach to life’s darknesses have then no other resource
to turn to (walk in the light of your fires); but, refusing the way of
trust and reliance, they incur divine opposition. The hand of God
goes out against them. Torment (ma‘“séba), is only found here
but its verb V‘dséb (e.g. 63:10) guarantees its meaning of grief,
pain and displeasure — even ‘the place of pain’ — specifically the
pains of sin under the curse of God (Gn. 3:13-14; 5:29).
d. Salvation in prospect: the watching remnant (51:1 — 52:12)
Isaiah 50:10 is important in Isaiah’s progressive delineation of
the Servant. When the Servant first appeared in 42:1, it was
logical to link him with the servant, Israel, of 41:8; but the
exposure of Israel as blind, bound and spiritually guilty (42:18-
25) ruled that identification out, and 48:1 together with 49:3
sealed the contrast between the Israel who had lost its right to the
name and the Servant who alone possessed the name. The
tailpiece to the Servant’s testimony in 50:4~9 takes matters
another step forward: the Servant is distinguished as the model
for all who would live the life of trust and reliance — in other
words, the identity of the Servant is not the believing remnant
within the nation. In 8:9-20 Isaiah made fear of the Lord (8:13),
finding refuge in him (14) and loyalty to his ‘testimony’, ‘law’
and ‘word’ (16, 20) the hallmarks of the remnant; but now that
‘fear’ and obedience are centred on the Servant, who is the point
of differentiation between believers (50:10) and unbelievers
(50:11). It is on this note that 51:1 launches the next section with
its opening address to all who pursue righteousness and seek the
LORD, i.e. the faithful remnant. It is a continuous and coherent
presentation: the opening three calls to listen (51:1, 4, 7) are
matched by the concluding three calls for alertness and action
(51:17; 52:1, 11). At the centre lies a dramatic appeal to the Lord
to act (51:9-11) followed by a meditative interlude (51:12-16).
i. Commands to listen: promises of salvation (51:1-8).
These three appeals are in sequence: the first (1-3), addressing
319
ISAIAH 51:1-3
the remnant, promises comfort to Zion (3). The promise is, however, couched in Abrahamic (2) and Edenic (3) terms, and these
worldwide implications are pursued in the second appeal (4-6)
with its promises to nations and islands (5). The third appeal (7—
8) is an affirmation that no opposition can survive (8ab) and that
the Lord’s purposes are eternal.(8cd). ;
Abraham, Zion and Eden (51:1-3). The me of verse 1 is the
I of verse 2, the Lord who called Abraham; but the last voice to
say Listen to me (1) was the Servant (49:1). Can we say Isaiah is
beginning to imply that there is more to the Servant than his
human origin (49:1) — a thought he will make more explicit in
53:1? 1-2. Pursue ... seek: both verbs belong to the vocabulary of
religious devotion. (For ‘pursue’, see Dt. 16:20; Pss. 34:14;
38:20; Pr. 21:21; Ho. 6:3; for ‘seek’, see Dt. 4:29; 2 Ch. 15:15;
20:4; Pss. 27:8; 105:4; Ho. 3:5.) Both simply express determination or commitment; just as ‘pursue’ does not picture
something out of reach, neither does ‘seek’ imply something lost.
The faithful ones pursue righteousness — that is, persevere in
conforming their lives to the revealed norms of God’s law —
and seek God’s presence. From the unpromising beginning of
Abraham and Sarah (2), the Lord produced the sons, nations and
kings he had promised (Gn. 17:3—7; Rom. 4:17—21; Heb. 11:11-
12). Isaiah does not dwell on the human impossibility of what the
Lord did in bringing a family out of barrenness; he focuses on the
solitariness of the progenitor — he was one and became many —
and he makes this the measure of what the Lord can do.
3. Comfort ... compassion are both from the same Hebrew
verb, as in 40:1. The doubling is an idiom of certainty (Gn.
41:32). Behind the word ruins lies the idea of aridity, therefore
barrenness. Deserts more generally means open countryside, land
not under cultivation but wastelands catches the idea exactly (the
Dead Sea is called ‘the Sea of the Wasteland’, Jos. 3:16). This
picture of transformation — the unproductive becoming fertile,
the wild ordered, the waste rich and abundant — is crowned by
the reference to Eden restored, an image going beyond order, beauty and richness to the removal of the curse (Gn. 3:18) and Ape restoration of creation to the divine intention: the new earth.
The world, light and salvation (51:4-6). If anything, this section confirms the thought that Listen (lit. ‘pay attention’) to me may well be the voice of the Servant, speaking in his divine nature. The verses are full of reminiscences of the first Servant passage (42:14, 5-9) with references to justice, light
320
ISAIAH 51:4-6
and righteousness. The created order in 42:5 illustrates the
Lord’s power to do as he has planned through his Servant;
here its transitoriness is a foil for his eternal salvation. LikeaS the reference to arm (5) prepares for verse 9 and looks on to
4. My nation: the word /° im is used in the plural meaning
‘peoples’, but the singular appears elsewhere only in Proverbs
11:26; 14:28 and in Genesis 25:23, which distinguished the
Jacob-line from the Esau-line. Isaiah is possibly recalling this and
making the point that, within the totality of all descendants, there
is found a true people — the ‘pursuers’ of verse 1. In 2:24 it was
the outgoing of law from the Lord’s city that drew in the nations,
and Isaiah recalls that truth here. Justice, as in 42:14, is part of
the vocabulary of revealed truth, the decisive declaration of the
Lord’s mind.
5. On the human side, righteousness is conformity to the
revealed character and claims of the Lord, the mark of his genuine people (1); on the divine side, it is the quality and standard of
all that the Lord does — for his people (49:25), for his Servant
(50:8, ‘vindicates’ = affirms my righteousness) or what the Servant does (53:11). In the present verse, salvation is what the Lord
does; righteousness is the quality which infuses it. His saving
work satisfies his righteous requirements. My arm (Sc) is literally
‘my arms’. It is possibly a plural of amplitude, the fullness of
divine personal action. The only other place where the plural is
used of the Lord is Deuteronomy 33:27: what was formerly
exclusive to Israel is now for the world.' Justice, settled divine
truth; islands (11:11; 40:15; 42:4), ‘earth’s remotest bounds’;
look to ... hope, cf. 42:4. In what sense do they wait and hope?
There are always those like Cornelius (Acts 10) who hunger for
greater light, but, at the deepest level, there is an inarticulate
human longing for a truly human life — the ‘eager expectation’ of
creation itself (Rom. 8:19). Through the Servant — my arm (see
53:1) — life will become life indeed (Jn. 10:10).
6. The Lord’s universal salvation (4-5) is also eternal. Even
the most durable things in our experience — heavens ... earth and
the continuance of humankind (inhabitants) — are transient, but
not so that salvation which satisfies the Lord’s righteousness.
Vanish, ‘be dispersed’, ‘fall to bits’; wear out, succumb to its own
1A. D. H. Mayes holds that Dt. 33 must have been in existence ‘some
considerable time before its incorporation in its present place in Deuteronomy’
(Deuteronomy [Oliphants, 1979], p. 397). Whatever date is accepted for
Deuteronomy, therefore, Isaiah could have had this reference in mind.
321
ISAIAH 51:7-9
evanescence; /ike flies is probably simply ‘in like manner’.’ Last
.. never fail: literally ‘be ... not be shattered’. “Be refers to
intrinsic durability, ‘not shattered’ to imperviousness to external
forces. Knowledge, imperturbability and confidence (51:7-8).
Those who know need not fear.and can rest assured that all will
be well.
7. What is right is ‘righteousness’. The righteousness which
they ‘pursue’ (1) is no external code but the indwelling reality of
minds (know) and hearts — at the centre of their personalities. But
what they are excites hostility, bringing reproach or ‘taunt’ and
insults — the noun occurs only here but has a close relative in
43:28 (‘scorn’; see also Zp. 2:8). The verb (Vgadap) is only once
used of verbal hostility to people (‘revile’, Ps. 44:16); its seven
other occurrences concern blasphemy against God. This indicates
the strength of the word Isaiah chose. Men (’“nds) is man in his
mortal frailty — which is all that human opponents ultimately
amount to! 8. Faith recognizes that, no matter how strong and interminable life’s hostilities are, forces of destruction are at work like
moth and worm in garments (8). Eat ... devour are the same
verb twice, another telling repetition (cf 3). Righteousness ...
salvation, cf. verse 5; last (lit. ‘be’), cf 6. For ever expresses intrinsic permanence; all generations expresses permanence within
human experience.
ii. A dramatic appeal: exodus past and future (51:9-11).
Like 45:8 following 45:1—7, the promises of 51:1-8 prompt an
excited appeal that the Lord will act without delay. Who is the
speaker? It cannot now be the Servant because (53:1) he is the
Arm of the Lord to whom this appeal is made; maybe it is the
prophet, excited beyond restraint by the vision he has enunciated;
maybe it is the believing remnant longing for the prompt
realization of all they have ever wanted. The fact is that the way
to react to the Lord’s promises is to pray urgently for their
fulfilment (cf Ps. 44:23).
9. Awake, awake: the doubling here is for emotional intensity of appeal. Just as the anthropomorphism of Exodus 2:24 suggests a sudden reviving of the divine memory after a long lapse, so here to the human eye it may have seemed that the Lord had gone to sleep over his promises. But it is anthropomorphism only in
; 'MT, k’mokeén, naturally means ‘in like manner’. As to ‘like flies’, the word kinnim (plural), ‘gnats’, occurs in Ex. 8:16. It is not found in the singular.
322
ISAIAH 51:10-11
the sense of calling on God to act with the same dispatch and
urgency that would be the case with us if we suddenly recollected
a long-overdue duty. Clothe: when the Lord dressed himself as a
soldier in Joshua 5:13, his garments revealed what he is and what
he intends. By ‘clothing himself with power’ the Lord marshals
all the almighty power of the divine nature and commits himself
so to act. Arm of the LORD, like so much else in these verses,
looks back to the exodus (Ex. 6:6; Dt. 4:34; 5:15; cf Ex. 15:16; 1
Ki. 8:42). Just as the ‘hand’ symbolizes personal agency, so the
‘arm’ symbolizes personal strength in action (52:10); here, the
Lord himself in his intervening mightiness. Not even the greatest
people of the Old Testament are described as the Lord’s arm.
Rather, ‘the Arm’ went with Moses (63:12) and strengthened
David (Ps. 89:20-21). The metaphor calls upon the Lord himself
to act. Rahab (meaning ‘loud mouth’) was Isaiah’s nickname for
Egypt (30:7; cf Ps. 87:4) and certainly Egypt was shattered by
the Lord’s exodus acts, but the reference here transcends the
historical. Rahab (‘Tiamat’) was also the sea monster, in
Canaanite-Babylonian mythology the deified personification of
disorder, typified by the restless, threatening sea, which the
creator-god Marduk must subdue before he may pursue the work
of ordered creation. The Bible, of course, knows of no such precreation combat of opposing forces, but it is not above using the
sea and Rahab as a means of asserting the sole and sovereign
power of the Lord (Jb. 26:11-12; Ps. 89:8ff.; Am. 9:3). Isaiah
does not give credence to the existence of such ‘gods’, but
signals in this way that the people of God are always challenged
in their loyalty by other claimants to devotion, yet their history
displays their God as the only God and One with power over all
the power of the enemy. The Red Sea crossing (10) exemplified
that the ‘sea’ for all its monstrous unruliness can do only the
Lord’s bidding (Ps. 93:3-4). Nothing can stand in his way,
neither impenetrable physical barriers nor supernatural powers.
10-11. See on 35:9-10, where Isaiah has already used these
words. Cf. the repetition of 48:22 in 57:21. By this interleaving of
words and ideas he binds the literature together. Here redeemed
looks back to Exodus 6:6, and ransomed looks forward to the
coming acts of God effecting his righteous salvation (5, 7) and
the renewal of Zion (3). The prayer of verse 9 modulates, under
the influence of God’s exodus acts (10), into the key of confident,
forward-looking faith (11).'
1 The thought that as a section of Isaiah ends at 35:10 so the matching words
at 59:11 should signal the end of another section — and likewise with 48:22 and
B23
ISAIAH 52:12
iii. Interlude: a final briefing (51:12-16). The doubling of J
... I (12) responds to the double awake, awake (9) — ‘I am every
bit as awake as you may need!’ At first sight these verses excite
doubts about their textual reliability: in verse 12a you is masculine plural; in 12bc, feminine singular; and in 13-16 masculine
singular! In 13-14 you is a cowering captive, but in 15-16 a
prophetic figure with a universal ministry.’ It would be the work
of seconds to harmonize all this, but it would leave the question
unanswered as to who is being addressed. It is better to ask if,
within the context, anyone matches the changes of masculine and feminine. The masculine singular of verses 15—16 matches the
Servant, endowed with the Lord’s word (16a, 42:4; 49:2; 50:4),
sheltered (16b, 49:2) and with a universal, Zion-centred task (16c-e, 42:1; 49:5-6). The doomed prisoner of 13-14 is a picture
drawn from captivity. The accusation (13a) of forgetfulness refocuses the complaint of 49:14. The feminine in 12bc is therefore desolate Zion, the ‘mother’ of her inhabitants. This leaves
the plural word of comfort (12a) as an address to all (Zion, the
captive and the Servant), and, significantly, 12b—-16 follow the same order (city, captives, Servant) that has already occurred in
49:14-21; 49:22 — 50:3; and 50:4~9, and that will be repeated in
51:17 — 52:2; 52:3-12; 52:13 — 53:12. The mosaic in verses 12—
16 is thus coherent. The Lord offers his reassurance to all the dramatis personae of the coming events.
12. J ... J: a duplication of intensity (see p. 322). The Lord
offers himself as the constant comforter (the verb is a participle)
to petrified Zion. Men is ’*ndés (cf. 7), but here human frailty is
underlined by three additions: mortal (lit. ‘who die’), sons of men
(‘Adam/humankind’) and grass (40:7-8). They suffer a threefold
frailty: death is at work, they are of (mere) human origin, and are essentially fragile.
In verses 13-15, Zion is encouraged (12bc) to look around in a
candid assessment of opponents; the masculine you addresses the
57:21 — has been canvassed. See p. 307 n. 1. This can only be decided pragmatically: does it ‘work’? And does it work more persuasively than other ways of
analysing the literature? I cannot personally find ways of analysing Isaiah along these lines, and therefore I look on the recapitulated words and thoughts as Isaiah putting down markers of this continuing authorship. : On wv. 12-16 North (Second Isaiah, p. 214) remarks that these verses are the Achilles’ heel of any theory that no subsequent additions were made to the original work of the prophet. This, however, will hardly do, for surely it is impermissible to solve problems by assuming these were lunatic sub-editors who worked without thought for sequence or syntax. Our first duty is to the text we have inherited; our second duty is to respect those through whose careful guardianship we have come into this inheritance.
324
ISAIAH 51:13-16
captive of verse 14, facing terror but encouraged to look up to
God. All the panic-making factors (13d—g, 14) are bracketed by
the Lord who is (13a—-c) your Maker, Lord of heavens and earth,
and (15) the LorD Almighty (lit. ‘of hosts’; 1:9), sovereign over all earthly forces.
13-14. Your: committed to you. Maker: the One who has
made you for himself (44:2) and will go on ‘making’ (the word is
a participle in the Hebrew) until you are what he intends.
Stretched ... laid the foundations are both participles. The
absolute sovereignty the Lord displayed in the original act of
creation continues in his direct managerial control of his created
world, where he is for ever over (heavens) and under (foundations). To forget him — to live without consciously holding in
mind and memory who he is, what he has done, what he promises
— is to live in defeat (Ps. 78:9-11) and disobedience (Ps. 78:40—
42). Terror ... wrath ... oppressor ... destruction were not the
conditions of the Babylon exile (Je. 29), and a prophet actually
living in the exile would not have spoken in this way. Here and in
verse 14 (cowering ... die ... dungeon ... bread) Isaiah is using
stereotypical images of captivity to underline how desperate in
reality are human needs — fearful, doomed and imprisoned — from
which the Lord can and will rescue. Die in their. dungeon: (lit.)
‘die into the pit’, ‘die as one doomed to the pit’. This may be a
metaphor of the condemned criminal — to die and be flung into a
common grave; but it is also a picture of death without divine
favour (38:17; Ps. 49:9), the opposite of the ransomed soul (Ps.
49:7-8, 14-15). 15. For I am (lit. ‘As for me, I am’) turns the gaze from plight
and fate (14) to the divine sufficiency. Sea pictures the turbulent
forces encountered in life (Ps. 93), but the raging is itself his
work (Ps. 107:25-26; Je. 31:35; Am. 4:13; 5:8; 9:56). If we find
ourselves ‘in the soup’, it is he who has decreed the recipe and
the temperature. Almighty (lit. ‘of hosts’): see 1:9.
16. The Lord now assures his Servant: his equipment (16a),
security (16b) and task (16c-e). The Servant’s prophetic status is
put first to emphasize what is of primary importance. What is true
of every prophet — the divine word in the human mouth (Je. 1:9;
Ezk. 2:7-3:4; Am. 1:1, 3) — will be true also of this great One.
But the covering hand is placed second in order to assure that the
same hand which hid him until the time came (49:2) still covers
him as he goes to his task. J who set (lit. ‘planted’) is an
extremely improbable translation of this, the first of three Hebrew
infinitives setting out what the Lord has in mind for his Servant
to do: ‘that I may (ie. through you)’ or ‘that you may (on my
325
ISAIAH 51:17-20
behalf) plant ... lay ... say’. Planting is a new beginning; laying
foundations represents permanence of achievement. The Servant is the origin of a new cosmic reality. Jeremiah (1 :9-10) was
called to ‘plant kingdoms’; the Servant will plant heaven and
earth, a new-creational work such as only God can do. Finally,
the Servant is ‘to say to Zion’: at the centre of the Lord’s cosmic
purposes is his people. My people: the ultimate fulfilment of the
covenant promise (49:8; Ex. 6:7).
iv. Commands to respond: what the Lord has done (51:17
— 52:12). Three double commands, balancing the three promises
of 51:1-8, suggest that the promises have been fulfilled and the
time has come to enter into them. Zion is called to wake up to the
fact that divine wrath is over and gone (51:17—23, esp. 22), to
wake up to holiness (52:1—-10) and to embark on a new exodus as pure pilgrims (52:11—12). But the question remains: how have the
promises been fulfilled? How has wrath been removed, holiness
established and the way opened for the pilgrims? The answer
comes with the final command in the series: ‘See, my servant’ (52:13).
Wrath removed (51:17-—23). The first promise (51:1—3) was
of Eden restored, the curse removed. So here the wrath of God is
over. This is where salvation begins: the satisfaction of the
requirements of a holy God (Rom. 1:16—-18). This section is in
two parts: the cup drunk (17-20 and the cup removed (21-23).
Divine wrath reduced Jerusalem to helplessness, but while she
slept the cup has been removed: the wrath is over.
17-18. Cup: the picture of the cup is of the Lord blending all
life’s experiences for his people (Ps. 16:5), and this includes
mixing a cup of wrath for sinners (Ps. 11:6, NIV ‘lot’; 75:8). So
Jerusalem was paid for her unbelief by being bereaved of all her
sons (‘children’) and left helpless.
19-20. Duplication is an idiom of totality, and Jerusalem’s
troubles came in twos: ruin and destruction destroying the fabric
of the city, famine and sword destroying its population. Who can
console you? is (lit.) ‘Who I can comfort you?’, meaning either
‘How can I comfort you?’ — presumably Isaiah admitting inability — or ‘Who but I can comfort you?’, i.e. the Lord, who commands comfort (40:1; 51:3, 12), advertises himself as the only hope. The former is possibly more usual for the idiom and suits the context: ruined and helpless, there is no comfort when the wrath of God falls. The duplication continues with the picture of the doubly helpless sons (20), both fainted and caught, under a double imposition of wrath and rebuke. In summary, when wrath falls,
326
ISAIAH 51:21-23
there is no help (18), no comfort (19) and no future (20a-c).
21-22. Therefore introduces (not human but) divine
conclusions from 18-20. Afflicted (‘downtrodden’): in this case,
under divine wrath. Drunk resumes the metaphor of the ‘cup’ (17;
cf. 29:9), the exact measuring out of wrath. The therefore of verse
21 — held in suspense while the prophet described the humiliated
city — is now further delayed while he describes the Lord. First,
he is Sovereign. Exceptionally, Isaiah uses the plural of the word
here (‘“donayik) usually reserved for human relationships — as of
husband to wife (1 Ki. 1:17), parent to child (Gn. 31:35). Could it
be that Isaiah chose this form here in order to stress that the
divine lordship comes down into the ordinary affairs of life?
Transcendent though he is, his sovereignty is not remote but
practical and everyday. Secondly, he is the LORD, revealed once
and for all as the God who saves his people and overthrows his
foes (Ex. 3:15; 6:6—7); thirdly, your God, the God who has freely
committed himself to you and your welfare; and, fourthly, the
God of absolute justice and legality who defends (Vrib), ‘pleads
the cause’ of his people, takes their case to the bar of his justice.
Now at last the conclusion that the Lord has reached is stated:
See, I have taken (22c). The poor drunkard is awakened to a
wondrous fact: the cup has gone from the hand that so justly held
it. Wrath was deserved, wrath was measured out, wrath is gone —
and gone for ever (you will never drink it again). This is the logic
of God to which therefore (21) was the introduction — a logic
operating within the divine nature whereby the due reward of
their deeds is, with perfect justice, averted and wrath satisfied.
23. At the exodus the Lord’s redemption of his people
coincided with his just visitation on their captors who had refused
to obey his word (cf 10:5—15). But it was not the execution of
wrath on Egypt which redeemed Israel (else why was the Passover sacrifice needed?). The removal of wrath from the one and
the infliction of wrath on the other were two sides of perfect
divine justice. But the question yet to be answered here is what
Passover work of God waits to be revealed as the explanation of
verse 22. For his wrath does not evaporate; it demands
satisfaction. Holiness enjoyed (52:1—10). In verses 1-2, Zion is awakened
to a new condition of holiness (1b—d), separation (lef) and
royalty (2); the initial For of verse 3 introduces an explanation: a
free redemption (3), bondage (4-5) ended by divine self-revelation (6), bringing the triumphant news to Zion (7-10). There is
a tension between the ‘already’ of verses 1-2, Zion awaking to
holiness; the ‘not yet’ of verses 3-6, the Lord pondering the need
327
ISAIAH 52: 1-4
of his people; and the ‘now’ of verses 7-10, the divine action accomplished. Logically and chronologically the sections should be
in a different order, but drama dictates otherwise. In effect, then,
Zion can awake to holiness (1—2) because (for, 3) the Lord contemplated her need (3-6) and took action (7-10).
1. The ideal of priestly people (Ex. 19:4-6) had never been
realized (cf, Ex. 33:26; Nu. 8:5-22), but, on awaking (la), Zion
finds the priestly garments laid out for her (1bc) and a new reality
as the holy (1d) and separated city (2). It was not the Lord who
was asleep (51:9) after all — though in a dark day it is easier to ~
blame him than to walk believingly in the darkness (50:10).
Clothe: on the metaphor of clothing, see 51:9. The background to
the garments of splendour (lit. ‘beauty’) is Exodus 28:2. The requirements of the Lord’s holiness were met in 51:17—23; now
divine holiness is shared with his people. Uncircumcised and
defiled: in this envisaged holy Zion, each possesses a legitimated membership (one of the significances of circumcision, Ex. 12:43—
44) and each displays a conformed (no longer defiled) character
and life. When Aaron donned the garments of holiness, there was
an element of unreality: a disparity between claim and character.
It will be so no longer (Heb. 12:22—24 ; Rev. 21:27).
2. Babylonian bondage ended at 48:21. After that point Isaiah
continues to use the images of bondage, but only as illustrative of
a spiritual state to be remedied. In this present verse, what the
Lord had actually done for the archetypal King David (1 Sa. .
30:1; 2 Sa. 1:1; 2:1-4; Ps. 113:7-8) is now available to his
people. Priests already (1), they are now kings as well. Surely not
only the parallel with David but the contrast with Babylon (47:1) was in Isaiah’s mind.
In verses 3-6, in explanation of the new city (For, 3), the Lord
looks at the past (3b) and pledges coming redemption (3c); next
he looks at the present (4) and sees his name dishonoured; and finally he looks at the future and announces a coming revelation of himself (5-6).
3. Sold: passed into other ownership (see on 50:1); note esp. the references in Judges which show that the Lord still retained ownership which he could resume at will (2:14; 3:8; 4:2). For nothing: the sale did not reach the point where money changed hands and the deal was sealed. Redeemed (Vga’al): see 35:10. Redemption is essentially a price-paying concept, so what does without money (lit. ‘not for money’) mean? Either without cost to you, or by some payment other than money. Someone else will pay — and the price will not be silver (1 Pet. 1:18-19), 4. Notice the change from LORD (3) to Sovereign LORD.
328
ISAIAH 52:5-6
Recalling Egypt and considering Assyria, Isaiah suitably recalls a
sovereignty over all earth’s powers. Jo live (Vgiir): to take up
residence as a protected alien. Jacob entered Egypt by Pharaoh’s
invitation (Gn. 45:16ff.), but the laws of hospitality were later
violated and Pharaoh’s edict of ethnic cleansing was enacted (Ex.
1:10—22). Lately, Assyria: a prophet living in Babylon during the
terminal years of the Babylonian empire could not say Jately (lit.
‘at the end’, b©’epes). How very aware the Lord is of his suffering
people (Ex. 3:7)!
5-6. Two things move the Lord: the misery of his people
(Sbe), and the honour of his name (5de). What do I have here?:
cf. 22:1, 16.' The expression is used either incredulously, ‘What
do I think I am playing at?’ / ‘What can I have been thinking?’, or
seriously, ‘Does this matter to me?’ Those who rule them mock:
literally, as MT stands, ‘their rulers wail’. Isaiah had lived through
the day when he saw the weeping helplessness of Hezekiah
before the Assyrians (37:14) — and if rulers are helpless, how
grim is the state of the people (2 Ki. 6:26—27)! Here, the helpless
tears picture their spiritual plight, helpless in their sin. Al/ day
long ... constantly: in 51:13, the same Hebrew words referred to
the people’s plight; here, to the dishonour to the Lord’s name.
What hurts them hurts him. Therefore ... therefore (6): the
repetition expresses emotional intensity. First, the people will
come to a new appreciation of the Lord’s name (6a) — events will
confirm all that the name means, the eternal name of Exodus
3:15, the Redeemer of Israel. Secondly, in this coming day the
Lord will be present himself (6b—d), in word (J who foretold) and
in person (it is J). At the exodus, the Lord set up a mediator to
speak for him (Ex. 6:28 — 7:3; 19:9); in this coming day he
himself will speak and he himself will be there.
In verses 7-10 the focus changes again. Dramatically Isaiah
brings us to the very moment when the ‘awake, awake’ (1)
sounds in Zion’s ears as a messenger comes over the hills to
announce salvation and proclaim a sovereign God (7). Zion’s
watchmen cannot contain themselves (8), and the joy spreads
through the city (9ab). The Lord has himself acted to save (9c—
10). The fourfold message of verse 7 and the fourfold ground of
rejoicing (9c-10) bracket the swelling joy of the city (8—9b).
1The idiom mah-li-poh (‘What-to-me-here?’) has differing shades of
meaning: ‘What brings you here?’ (1 Ki. 19:9); ‘What’s the matter with you?’
(Gn. 21:17); ‘What do you want?’ (Est. 5:3); ‘What right have you?’ (Is. 3:15);
‘What do you think you’re playing at?’ (Jon. 1:6); ‘What concern is it of yours?’
(Ho. 14:8); ‘What does it signify to you?’ (Ex. 12:26).
529
ISAIAH 52:7-10
7-8. Those is singular in the Hebrew, ‘the one’; not a straggle
of fugitives from a defeat, but a single runner (as in 2 Sa.
18:24 ff.) with shining face and a spring in his step because he
comes with good news. Good tidings repeats the same word for
emotional intensity (lit. ‘good news of good’). Peace: the picture
is news from the battle, but the reality is the end of God’s wrath
(51:17-23), the city awaking to holiness (52:1), the status of its people as priests and kings (52:1, 2), redemption without cost
(52:3) — in a word, peace with God. Salvation: the divine victory
over every binding foe, the power of sin’s oppression broken.
Your God reigns: the cry of the herald of good tidings comes full
circle from the third comforting voice of 40:10—11. They used to
sing ‘The LORD reigns’ in their temple songs (Ps. 93:1; 97:1; 99:1), living. then in the same faith as Christians who sing Ascension Day hymns of the present reign of the Lord Jesus. But
Isaiah envisages a day (still future for us, too) when faith will
pass into sight and, when the LORD returns to Zion, they will see
it with their own eyes (8). Hard on the heels of the herald comes
the Lord himself. With their own eyes: literally ‘eye to eye’. This
does not mean, as with us, ‘with agreement’ but ‘with total
clarity’.
9-10. Ruins: as we have seen, in so many ways 42:18—25 set
the scene for all that has followed: not only did it make a radical
distinction between the Servant of 42:14 and Israel the nationservant, but also, in setting out the reasons why the nation could |
not be this Servant, it linked political facts (‘plundered’, ‘looted’,
‘trapped in pits’, ‘prisons’, 42:22) with the spiritual faults (‘no
attention’, ‘hear nothing’, 20; ‘we have sinned’, ‘not follow’, ‘not
obey’, 24; ‘not take to heart’, 25). By 48:20-21 the political
problem had been solved, and in 48:22 — 49:13 the Servant was
confirmed to solve the spiritual problem. We need constantly to
bear in mind, then, that from that point onwards the images of
captivity act, as they did in 42:18-25, as evidences of spiritual
need. Comforted: see 40:1; 49:13; 51:3, 12. The Lord has done what he said: he has redeemed. Arm: the symbol of personal strength in action; bare: with sleeves rolled up for work. Sight ... see: the former is the public nature of the divine act; the latter, oo ae participation in the experience (Pss. 49:19; 89:48;
The greater exodus (52:11—12). The calls to ‘awake’ (51:17; 52:1) invited entrance into provided blessings; depart (11) calls for the entrance upon a new lifestyle, that of holy pilgrimage involving abandonment of the old life. Once the Passover had been offered, there could be no tarrying in Egypt! The same
330
ISAIAH 52:11-—12
offering which made peace with God (Ex. 12:13) could be eaten
only by those committed to pilgrimage (Ex. 12:11), and the
blood-marked door which welcomed them into salvation (Ex.
12:24) ushered them out into pilgrimage (Ex. 12:33, 37).
11. Touch no ... be pure: negative and positive holiness,
separation from and to. The vessels: most commentators relate
this to Ezra 1:7-11, the historical return from Babylon to Zion.
This ignores the dramatic change of focus that we noted
immediately above whereby, from 48:22 onwards, the motifs of
Captivity — or, here, release — are within the context of the Lord’s
work of redemption from sin. The exodus pilgrimage provides all
the clues, except that now the Lord’s whole people are his holy
priesthood (52:1) and are called here to live according to their
God-given dignity. Numbers 1:50-51 is the only other place
where ‘carry’ and vessels of the Lord occur together; it refers to
the levitical duty of porterage, to be shared with no other (Nu.
3:5ff.). Now all who go out in this greater, truer exodus are the
tribe of Levi, the priests of the Lord.
12. Haste ... flight: contrast 48:20; Exodus 12:11. There is
now no opposing power that can keep them in bondage. Indeed,
to the contrary, they come under every possible divine care
(before ... rear); cf. the caring warrior of 40:10-11. The imagery
here is from Joshua 6:9, the guards marching before and behind
the priests, and from Exodus 13:21; 14:19, in which the pillar that
leads also guards.
e. Worldwide salvation (52:13 — 55:13)
As we would now expect, this climactic section falls into two
parts: the fourth Servant Song (52:13 — 53:12) and its ‘tailpiece’.
The latter extends to two chapters (54:1 — 55:13) in which, first,
Zion is called into a covenant of peace (54:10) and, secondly, the
invitation to the free banquet goes out to all (55:1—13).
i. The triumph of the Servant (52:13 — 53:12). Isaiah starts
with an enigma: how can such an exaltation (13) arise out of such
suffering (14); how can such suffering (14) lead to universal
benefit and acknowledgment (15)? The Lord’s testimony to his
Servant (13) blends into the statement of suffering and benefit
(14-15). Balancing this opening there is the concluding section
(53:10-12) which solves the enigma: the Servant’s suffering was
a bearing of sin. This time the explanation of his sufferings (10—
11b) blends into the Lord’s testimony to his Servant (11c—12).
The three intervening stanzas follow a theme of birth (53:2) to
death (53:9): how he grew up to an adult life of rejection and
SBP!
ISAIAH 52:13-15
sorrow (1-3), the hidden explanation of his sorrow and suffering
(4-6), and how such suffering reached its outcome in death and
burial (7-9). 4
A surprising success (52:13-15). Exaltation (13) followed on
from cruel suffering (14), with worldwide consequences (15).
13. The command to watch (see) is in effect the last of the
series of commands which began in 51:1. They were glorious in
their implications but lacking in explanations. After each in turn
we want to say, ‘Yes, but how will this happen?’ The command to
see brings us into the realm of accomplishment: watch the Servant and what he did. Act wisely: Vsakal is wisdom to know
exactly what to do in a given situation so as to bring the intended
result. This wise and successful action will bring the Servant a threefold exaltation (raised ... lifted up ... highly exalted) — a trio
which many link with the threefold exaltation of Jesus Christ in
resurrection, ascension and heavenly enthronement.
Verses 14-15 can be understood structurally in two ways.
First, the just as clause of 14a is taken up by the so clause in 15a.
Corresponding to an understandable reaction of horror (14a)
there is the matching outcome of sprinkling/startling (see NIV
mg., ‘marvel’). Just as many were appalled, so many will benefit.
This perhaps involves a stress on many that is more than the
Hebrew requires, but otherwise it is free from difficulty. Secondly, Hebrew does not always express the ‘so’ which completes
an ‘as ... so’ construction. Maybe, in the present case, the initial
horror (14a) is elaborated by a double explanation (so disfigured
... marred, 14bc) based on what they see, and the subsequent
reaction (shut their mouths, 15b) is elaborated by a double
explanation (15cd). The framework of these verses would then
be, ‘Just as many ... (so) kings ...” — the measure of shock-horror
will be the measure of amazed response. In this case the
comment so will he sprinkle (15a) stands at the midpoint as the
pivot of the whole. In general, this second view is fuller and more exact. 14. Many (see 15a; 53:11c, 12ae) is a keyword in this passage for the beneficiaries of the Servant’s suffering. Appalled
(Vsamam): ‘shocked, shattered’ (49:8, 19; 54:1), a very strong word. Man ... human likeness: the former refers to individuality, the latter to common humanity. The Servant’s sufferings brought such a disfigurement that those who saw said not only, ‘Is this he?’ but ‘Is this human?’ _ 15. Sprinkle (hiphil \ndzé): this verb (occurring twenty-two times in the Old Testament) deals with hallowing persons (Ex. 29:21) and things (Lv. 8:11), cleansing (Lv. 14:7) and atonement
332
ISAIAH 53:1-3
(Lv. 16:14-16). The meaning ‘startle’ is not found elsewhere.
Neither meaning is wholly free of difficulty. In its wellexemplified usage as ‘sprinkle’, there is always a preposition
(‘on’) governing the object sprinkled (e.g. 63:3), but here there is
no preposition before many nations, which stands as a direct
object. Regarding ‘startle’, the meaning derives from Arabic,
where the verb means ‘to jump up’, but where it is only used literally and never in an emotional sense (‘you made me jump’).
Thus ‘startle’ imports a verb unexemplified in the Old Testament,
in a meaning unexemplified anywhere, in order to solve a very
minor variation from the customary usage of a well-known verb
in an established meaning.’ The priestly idea of atonement
sprinkling (e.g. Lv. 4:6, 17; 5:9) is suitable to this context, and
the element of surprise that such blessed results of cleansing and
atonement should follow such tortured suffering is what makes
kings shut their mouths, i.e. be dumbfounded. New truth has
come to them, formerly untold, unheard before, but now seen and
understood. The next three stanzas of the poem explain what it is.
The man who is God: suffering observed but misunderstood (53:1—3). This stanza asserts two truths about the
Servant: on the one hand, he was the arm [or ‘Arm’] of the LORD
(1); on the other, he was truly human (2-3).
1. Believed (he’*min I°) means to believe what someone has
said, but in this case statement was not enough; the truth needed
also to be revealed. There was hearing (message) and seeing
(appearance, 2) but no believing without revelation. Revealed
(Vgald): to uncover objectively (1 Sa. 9:15, uncovering truth), or
subjectively (1 Sa. 20:12, lit. ‘uncover your ear’). The particular
truth that needs this divine uncovering concerns the arm of the
LorD. In 51:9 the ‘arm of the LORD’ was the Lord himself, acting
in person at the exodus; in 52:10 the arm is bared, the sleeves
rolled up for action, because the Lord purposes again to act
personally. We could suitably paraphrase Isaiah: ‘Who could
have believed that this was the Arm of the Lord?’, ie. the Lord
himself come to act in salvation, as promised in 52:10.
2-3. The first thing that made it incredible to look at the
Servant and see the Arm of the Lord was that he grew up before
1]t is not altogether a foregone conclusion that the thing on which the
sprinkling is done is never a direct object. In Lv. 4:16-17 (cf. 4), ’et-p‘né has the
sign of the definite object (ef) and, while the translation ‘before’ is allowable (e.g.
*et-p’né, Gn. 19:13), the translation ‘the face of/the surface of’ cannot be dismissed out of hand. But, in respect of Is. 52:14, it is certainly more acceptable
to allow a minor adjustment of an established verb in its established meaning than
to import an unknown verb in a meaning it does not exemplify elsewhere.
333
ISAIAH 53:4
him. He was distinct from the Lord (before him). He was also
plainly human, with a natural growth (tender shoot), and a
traceable human ancestry (root out of dry ground). Furthermore,
he looked unimpressive (no beauty ... to attract). To such an
extent was he but a man among men that the ordinary tests of
beauty (‘looks’), majesty (‘impressiveness’) and appearance
could be applied — with negative results. He was not the Lord
(before him), not expected (out of dry ground), not special
(beauty ... appearance). Only those to whom truth was revealed
could see that this was the arm of the LORD. Consequently he was
shunned (3a-c) and misunderstood (3d). Man of sorrows: sorrows makes a ‘domino’ link between verses 3 and 4, and it is only
in 4 that we discover that his sorrow and suffering arose not from
a sickly constitution but because he took our sorrows as his own. Esteemed is an ‘accounting’ word, a reckoning up of value. They
saw ordinariness (2), the world would call him an ‘unfortunate’
(3b), so they did not choose to follow him (3a) but turned from
him (3c). They appraised what they saw and it added up to
nothing (3d).
The substitute: suffering explained (53:4—6). These verses
are central to this whole Servant passage: bracketed by verses
dealing with birth and life (1-3) and trial and death (7-9), and by
passages of introduction (52:13—15) and conclusion (53:10-12).
They stress that what the Servant did he did alone: the emphatic
pronoun he (4a) separates him from us in what he did; we were
separate from him in what we thought (4cd); he was the agent,
the beneficiaries (5); the Lord isolated him for an awful task 6).
4. The Servant is the Agent, we are the uncomprehending
onlookers. Surely (akén): a conjunction emphasizing the unexpected (e.g. 40:7). He ... we: emphatic, ‘he for his part/it was he
who’ ... “yet as for us, we ...” Took up ... carried: the imagery is
drawn from Leviticus 16:22, which uses the first of these verbs.
To ‘take up’ (Vndsa’) is to lift a burden; to ‘carry’ (Vsabal) is to
‘shoulder’, to accept that burden as one’s own. Infirmities ...
sorrows: both words derive from verse 3, where the former is translated ‘suffering’. In 3, the sufferings were thought to be personal and led to the Servant being shunned; here the sufferings are misunderstood as a divine infliction (a disfavour of God directed personally against the Servant). Just as the person of the Servant (a genuine man who was also the Arm of the Lord) could be grasped only by revelation, so also the true understanding of his sufferings: that they were deliberately ‘taken’ by him and that they were in reality ours. Matthew 8:17 (cf Rev. 21:4) sees this
334
ISAIAH 53:5-6
verse fulfilled in the healing work of the Lord Jesus, as indeed it
is: for our total redemption, body as well as soul, comes from
him and from his work on the cross, and in the new heaven and
new earth sickness will be as completely banished as will sin.
Here, however, the main emphasis is on the damage (infirmities)
and blight (sorrows) that sin brings to us.
5. The pronoun he is again emphatic, so as to bring the
Servant sharply before us — ‘He (and no other)’. Pierced: as in
51:9; when they called on the Arm of the Lord who dealt the
monster Rahab a death blow, they did not know they were calling
the Arm to his own death. Crushed: used of cruel agonies ending
in death (La. 3:34). For ... for: the preposition min means ‘from’,
hence it is used of one thing arising from another, a relationship
of cause and effect. Our transgressions were the cause, his
suffering to death the effect. Like verse 4, this verse cannot be
understood without the idea of substitution to which, here, the
adjective ‘penal’ must be attached. Transgressions (pesa’), wilful
rebellions (1:2, 28; 43:25; 44:22; 46:8; 50:1); iniquities (‘awon),
the pervertedness, “bentness’, of fallen human nature (1:4; 5:18;
6:7; 40:2; 43:24; 50:1). Punishment (misar): ‘correction’ by
word or act, ‘chastisement’. Just as ‘covenant of peace’ (54:10)
means ‘covenant which pledges and secures peace’ so (lit.) ‘punishment of our peace’ means punishment which secured peace
with God for us. This peace was lost (48:18) by disobedience,
and, since it cannot be enjoyed by the wicked (48:22), the Servant stepped forward (49:1) to bring us back to God (49:6). This
is what he achieved by his substitutionary, penal sufferings.
Upon: the same preposition as used in Leviticus 16:21—22. By:
the particle of price, ‘at the cost of’. Wounds (habbira): used in
1:6 of open, untreated lacerations, hence the actuality of blows
inflicted and experienced. Healed: (lit.) ‘there is healing for us’,
the accomplished reality of restored wholeness. 6. What the Servant did, the Lord did. After the concentration
on the Servant in verses 4-5, the change of subject here is very
striking, as is also the precedence given to us and our self-will as
compared with the precedence of the Servant’s saving work in 4—
5. Coupled with the new subject, this has the force of saying with
astonishment, ‘To think that he would do that for people like us!’
We all at the beginning is matched by us all at the end: the perfect
equivalence of remedy to need. All ... each: common culpability,
individual responsibility. Like sheep ... astray: the folly and
thoughtlessness of sin leading to the danger inherent in being
sheep without a shepherd. Turned: the deliberateness of sin.
And the LORD: with this emphatic subject Isaiah corrects the
255
ISAIAH 53:7-8
misunderstanding involved in ‘stricken by God’ (5) — revelation
corrects incomprehension: he was indeed stricken by God, but
with the astonishing purpose of laying our sin on him. /niquity: as
in 5. Laid: (lit.) ‘caused to meet’, descriptive of the divine act of
gathering into one place, on to one substitutionary Victim, the
sins of all the sinners whom-the Lord purposed to save. The
Servant is the solution of the LORD to the needs of sinners.
Voluntary acceptance of death (53:7-9). Matching the
‘narrative’ aspect of verses 1-3, Isaiah now records the procession to the place of execution (7), the execution (8) and the burial (9). Verse 7 stresses voluntary acceptance, 8 injustice, and
9 finality. 5 : 7. Oppressed: e.g. Exodus 3:7. Afflicted is the verb used in
verse 4d, but what was imposed there is voluntarily accepted
here. The verbal form here (reflexive niphal), with an emphatic
pronoun, means ‘but he for his part submitted himself’. Did not
open ... Silent ... did not open: animals go as uncomprehending to
slaughter as to shearing, but the Servant who knew all things
beforehand (Jn. 18:4) went to his death with a calm silence that
reflected not an uncomprehending but a submitted mind and
tongue. Lamb ... sheep: the former was used in the sacrifices (Gn.
22:7-8, etc.), though not the latter, but this is of no significance.
Verses 4—6 have already established that we are to think of the
Servant’s death in terms laid down in the levitical sacrifices. The
point here is the contrast between the silence of ignorance and the
silence of deliberate self-submission. Yet a great principle of the
sacrificial system is involved. Verses 4—6 first established our
sinfulness (4-5), and then revealed it as our common folly (6a)
and our individual culpable choice (6b). This is to say, sin
involves the will. But this is precisely the point at which animals
can only picture the substitute we require and cannot actually be
that substitute: they have no consciousness of what is afoot nor of
any deliberate, personal, self-submissive consent to it. Ultimately
only a Person can substitute for people. This is the importance of
the stress in verse 7 on the Servant’s voluntariness expressed in
on acceptance of humiliation and the deliberately maintained silence.
8. By oppression and judgment can be translated in different ways. NIV points to an oppressive use of judicial procedures: ‘without restraint and without right’ describes victimization; ‘without restraint and without justice’ conveys injustice to which no limits were set; ‘from arrest/prison and sentence’ offers fact without comment — this is what happened. Who can speak of his descendants?: a very free rendering, meaning that the Servant
336
ISAIAH 53:9
was cut off in his prime, leaving no family — as (presumably)
does ‘Who will declare his generation?’ (NKJV). But better is
‘Who of his generation considered ... ’ (NIV mg.), ie. to his
sufferings was added the pain of total lack of sympathetic understanding from those around. Cut off: ‘hacked off’ (Vgazar), a
violent verb (1 Ki. 3:24). From the land of the living: cf. 38:11;
Psalms 27:13; 116:9; 142:5; etc. If the verb ‘cut off’ were not
enough to indicate that the Servant was done to death, these additional words demand it. For (min): as in verse 5, ‘because of’.
Transgression: ‘rebellion’. He was stricken: Isaiah is again
correcting the misapprehension of verse 3. Both NIV and NIV
margin (fo whom the blow was due) are allowable. In each case
the idea of substitution is fundamental, though, of course, explicit
in the marginal rendering. 9. Wicked ... rich: the former is plural and the latter singular. If
Isaiah had merely intended the contrast between a shameful and a
sumptuous burial he would have used two singulars. The use of a
plural and a singular suggests that he is talking not about
categories but about actual individuals. He offers no explanation,
nor is there one until the fulfilment: Matthew alone of the
Gospels specifies that Joseph of Arimathaea was ‘rich’ (27:37; cf
Mk. 15:43; Lk. 23:50); John brings out the contrast between the
expected (19:31) and the actual (19:38ff.) burial of Jesus. But, as
Isaiah foretold, ‘His burial was appointed with wicked men but
(he was) with the rich man in his death.’ Death, literally ‘deaths’,
is to be understood as a plural of majesty, ‘his supreme, wondrous death’.'! Though or ‘because’: the former points the contrast
between what happened (7-9b) and what was merited (9cd); the
latter explains the unexpected splendour of his burial. Violence is
active hostility against people (e.g. Gn. 49:5; Pr. 10:6, 11); deceit
is a state of the heart; mouth specifies sins of speech (Mt. 12:34).
Together they affirm the sinlessness of the Servant in thought,
word and deed. Thus Isaiah completes the picture of the Servant
as our Substitute, for he displays all the needed characteristics:
acceptable to the offended God (6), without stain of our sin (9),
identified with us in our need (4-5) and voluntarily standing in
our place (7-8).
1 The plural ‘deaths’ occurs only in Ezk. 28:10. This throws no light on Is.
53:9. Unexpected plurals of the same order as ‘deaths’ here are exemplified by
‘graves’ (Jb. 17:1; 21:32), which GKC 124c and E. Dhorme (A Commentary on
the Book of Job [Nelson, 1967]) class as ‘plurals of extension’, i.e.
‘graveyard / place of graves’. The same plural in 2 Ki. 22:20 and 2 Ch, 1:14 must
be a plural of amplification / majesty, ‘his splendid / royal grave’. The idea of ‘his
wondrous death’ would be very suitable to the present context.
337
ISAIAH 53:10-11
The Servant triumphant (53:10-12). Isaiah does not use the
word ‘resurrection’, but these verses display the Servant ‘alive
after his suffering’ (Acts 1:3). Not, however, alive in the usual
Old Testament sense that the dead possess the half-life of Sheol.
There could not be a greater contrast than between the vaingloriousness of the erstwhile-king of 14:9-12 and this majestic
One. The dead (9) is alive (10), the condemned (8) is righteous
(11), the helpless (7) is the victor (12).
10. This verse begins and ends on the topic of the LORD’s will
... the will of the LORD. The Lord accomplished his will through
his Servant’s suffering (10a); the Servant lives to prosper what
the Lord has done. Or, to put it another way: the Servant’s
suffering achieved salvation; the Servant is now the Executor of the salvation he achieved. The Lord was the architect of his
suffering; he lives to apply its achievements. And though: there
are three main ways of translating this line. (a) ‘When you make
his soul a guilt offering’: NIV (whose though is surely erroneous)
adapts this by making it explicit that ‘you’ is the Lord. This
means that the Lord was the effective Agent behind the Servant’s
saving work and, therefore, it is effective in both its objective
fruits (offspring, 10c) and its subjective rewards (prolong). (b)
‘When his soul makes a guilt-offering’: the precious reality at the
heart of the saving work is the person (‘soul’) of the Servant.
Because he was so uniquely fitted to be the substitute, his saving
work was successful. (c) ‘When you make his soul a guiltoffering’: here ‘you’ is the individual drawing near to the Servant
to nominate him as the needed offering for guilt, thus making his
personal, individual response to what the Servant has done. Each
of these is legitimate as a translation and significant as a truth. If
we can see more than one meaning in what he wrote, we may be
sure that Isaiah did too, and that he deliberately left it like that.
The guilt offering is found in Leviticus 5:1 — 6:7. The heart of its distinctiveness is its insistence on minute exactness between sin
and remedy. It could well be called the ‘satisfaction-offering’. It
is used here not so much to affirm that the Servant bore and discharged the guiltiness of our sin, but that what he did is exactly equivalent to what needed to be done. Offspring: we strayed as sheep, we return as sons. The Servant’s work is suc- cessful in ‘bringing many sons to glory’ (Heb. 2:10) but, because it was perfectly done according to the will of the LORD, it results also in his own prolongation in life — as Romans 4:25 says about the resurrection.
11. Afier is the preposition min (as in 5, 8) and should again be “because of’ (cf Heb. 2:9). See the light of life: this’ is the only
338
ISAIAH 53:12
really significant difference between MT and Q*. The former has
‘he shall see ... be satisfied’ and the latter ‘he shall see light’. NIV
expands this to ‘the light of life’. If the reading ‘light’ is correct,
it has the metaphorical meaning of ‘joy’, a happy outcome. But
this, too, is what MT means: (lit.) ‘he shall see, he shall be
satisfied’ is an idiomatic way of saying ‘he shall be satisfied with
what he sees’. The verse goes on to say what it is that delights the
Servant: by his knowledge, i.e. because he knows exactly what is
required in order to save sinners, my righteous servant, i.e. ‘that
righteous One, my Servant’, an emphatic divine commendation,
will justify many (a unique turn of Hebrew phrase), i.e. ‘will
provide righteousness for the many’. ‘The many’ is Isaiah’s keyword for those whom the Servant designed to save: what Jesus
calls ‘all that the Father gives me’ (Jn. 6:37). Over these he casts
the robe of his own righteousness. We are not only family
members (10) but wear the family likeness. And: used in its
frequent explanatory sense, ‘you see’. Bear: ‘shoulder’ (see 4).
Every benefit and blessing come from the substitutionary work.
12. Great is actually ‘many’, and again refers to those whom
the Servant designed to save; but among the great ... with the
strong cannot be correct. It cannot be that this Servant who will
‘prosper’ with a threefold exaltation (52:13), before whom kings
are stunned into silence (52:14), who is alive from the dead and
the Executor of the Lord’s plans (53:10) will, in the event, share
the supreme place with any other. In the light of this, a closer
glance at the Hebrew yields, ‘Therefore I will apportion to him
the many’ (cf, again, Jn. 6:37), ‘and the strong he will apportion
as spoil’. Because: this great victory rests on four facts. (a) He
poured out: the Servant’s voluntary self-offering even to the point
of death (Phil. 2:8ff.); (b) was numbered: his identification with
those in need of salvation (we could translate, ‘He allowed
himself to be numbered’); (c) he bore the sin of many (i.e. of all
whom he designed to save): his effectiveness as substitute; and
(d) made intercession, probably better as ‘interposed’ but, of
course, it could refer to his mediatorial intercession whereby he
‘saves to the uttermost’ (Heb. 7:25): his work as mediator. The
latter verb, however, is used in verse 6 for ‘caused to meet’ (NIV
‘laid’). Just as the Lord placed him in the mediating position, so
he personally took it as his own.
ii. The great invitation (54:1 — 55:13). Like its predecessors,
the final Servant passage is followed by a ‘tailpiece’, which, as
befits its dignity, takes up two chapters. In 54:1 the invitation to
sing — to enter with joy into a provided benefit — goes out to a
339
ISAIAH 54: 1-4
barren woman, who turns out to be Zion (11-15). In 53:4 a
worldwide invitation to the feast goes out to all who desire to
come and eat freely, and this is seen as the fulfilment of the
promise that David will rule the world (3-4). Thus chapters 54 —
55 match 40:1 — 42:17, where the message of comfort to Zion
merged into a vision of world blessing. :
Zion restored: five pictures of benefit (54:1-17). Humanity
falls into two groups: those who possess the revelation of God
(whether they live comformably to it or not), and the rest who are
still to be brought within the circle of privilege. When the Servant has performed his great work of salvation (52:13 — 53:12),
the first invitation goes out to those already within the Lord’s
sphere, so that they may enter freely (sing, 1) into the benefits of
what the Servant has done.
1-3, Worldwide increase: the barren woman and the
spreading family. The link with the Servant is provided by the
reference to descendants (‘seed’) in verse 3 (cf. 53:10, offspring
= ‘seed’): his seed are the barren woman’s seed, the children of
salvation. The one who is barren (1; i.e. without ability to have a
child), who never bore (without a child in fact), and who is
desolate (without a chance to conceive since she is without a
husband’s care), will actually have more children than one who
has a husband. There is no natural explanation of this fertility.
Tent life (2) pictures an ‘ideal’ relationship between the Lord and
his people (Je. 2:1—3); cf 16:5, where the Messiah reigns ‘in the
tent of David’. Stretch ... strengthen: roominess and stability.
Spread: ‘burst’? — as we say ‘burst at the seams’, a picture of
vigorous growth. Dispossess (lit. ‘take possession of’) ... settle:
Genesis 22:17 says (lit.) ‘your seed will possess’, but only
Exodus 34:24, Deuteronomy 9:1; 11:23 and Joshua 23:9 — all
ultimately fulfilled in David — refer to ‘possessing the nations’
(cf: Ps. 2:8). Thus, out of the Servant’s work, both the Abrahamic
and Davidic promises are fulfilled.
4-8, Security in God: the solitary wife and the everlasting
love. The two pictures of widowhood (4) and a wife deserted (6)
could suggest, respectively, a dead and an unfaithful husband, and thus create a wholly wrong set of impressions. Isaiah is prepared to risk this in order to make us feel as sharply as possible the deadly results of sin and, correspondingly, the joyful results of salvation.
4. Shame... disgrace ... humiliated represent three synonymous Hebrew verbs sharing the fundamental idea of dis- appointed hopes, the embarrassment of expecting — even publicly announcing — one thing and then reaping another. In context here
340
ISAIAH 54:5—10
shame and reproach convey the same thought. Widowhood is
such a disappointment, such a blighting of bright hopes —
especially when it comes in youth. But fear can go for ever (4)
because there is a husband who cannot die (5), who wants his
wife back (6) and who pledges everlasting love (7-8).
5-8. Maker (5), see 44:2; LoRD Almighty, 1:9; Holy One of
Israel, 1:4; Redeemer, 35:9-10. As God of all the earth he cannot
be challenged, hindered or diverted from his promises by any
opposing power. Your God (6) is, as always, not the God you
chose but the God who has freely made himself yours. Behind
the pictures of widowhood (4-5) and desertion (6) lies the reality
of an angry God who turned away, hiding his face. This is the
reason why sin is like bereavement and desertion, because it
alienates the Holy One. Compassion (noun in 7, verb in 8) is the
emotional love which makes the heart beat faster (1 Ki. 3:26).
Kindness (8) is love as a commitment of will. A couple ‘fall in
love’ (compassion) and in marriage they pledge their love (kindness). Redeemer: the ever-present Next-of-Kin, at hand to meet
every need, bear every burden, pay every price.
9-10, The end of wrath: Noah and the covenant of peace.
This poetic meditation on the flood takes up the ‘surge of anger’
theme (6) from the last picture. The pledge that the waters of
Noah would never again cover the earth (Gn. 9:12-17) was
linked to the hanging up of the Lord’s war-bow (the translation
‘rainbow’ is contextual; the word is that for a fighting bow): the
war is over, the weapon has become a sign of peace, indeed a
covenant sign, a visible pledge of the Lord’s promise, an incitement to trust the Promise-maker. So also now there is the pledge
not to be angry ... to rebuke. The former is the outburst of exasperation (the same word as in 8); the latter is the mental attitude
lying behind such an outburst, a sense of being offended. Both in
emotion and in expression — i.e. totally — wrath is gone. For
Noah, a stable ordinance of creation became the guarantee of
peace with God, but Isaiah goes further: even should creation
lose its stable permanence with mountains (10) shaking and hills
(lit.) ‘tottering’, there is a covenant that cannot (lit.) ‘totter’. The
Servant bore the punishment that made peace (53:5) and now
that peace is a covenanted reality, more steadfast than the cosmic
fabric and rooted in the divine compassion (see 7-8). The
emotion of anger is gone for ever but the emotion of surging love
abides.
11-14, Untouchable security: the city of truth and
righteousness. The city theme is fundamental in Isaiah: the
Davidic city (1:26-27); the world city (2:2-4); the cleansed city
341
ISAIAH 54:11-14
(4:2-6); the joyous city (12:1-6); the ‘tale of two cities’ (24-26)
— one destroyed (24:10), the other redeemed, universal and strong
(25:1-9; 26:1-3); another ‘tale of two cities’ (47-52) — one fallen
(47:1), the other raised (52:1); the comforted city (66:10ff.). In
the first two pictures in this series (54:1-3, 4-8), desolate Zion
represented the Lord’s privileged people in their need of the
blessings the Servant achieved. In the final two pictures (54:11—
15, 16-17), the city represents beauty and security. Note how this makes the covenant of peace (9-10) the centre of the whole
series. 11-12. Afflicted, ‘humiliated’ by stronger forces; lashed ... ,
buffeted as by a tornado, defeated by circumstances; and not
comforted, without any external help. But now a comforter will
put an end-to the humiliation (build) and insecurity (foundations
... battlements ... gates) and will display his care in enrichment
and beautification. 13-14. The community which it encloses enjoys a relationship
with the Lord in the light of his truth (13a) and on the ground of
his righteousness (14a), and a total peace: peace with God (13b)
and peace from earthly disturbance (14b-e). Taught is limmidim,
as in 50:4ad. Like the Servant they are disciples, instructed in the
word of God. The gift of revealed truth has always marked off
the Lord’s people from all others. It was the distinguishing mark
of the city of 2:2-4. Jeremiah 31:34 predicts the identical
blessing, and offers no other explanation of it than that it is the
fruit of a full and final dealing with sin; so also in Isaiah, the
perfect work of redemption brings the redeemed into the central
privilege of being taught divine truth by a divine teacher. The
outward beauty, then, of precious stones (12) is matched by the
inner possession of the truth (13); the hidden reality of
foundations (11c) is matched by the secret ingredient of divine
righteousness (14a), the blessing bestowed by the Servant who
‘provides righteousness’ (53:11) for the many he designed to save. Tyranny (‘oSeq), a general word for disruptive forces at work within society; terror (m*sittd), assault from outside (Ps. 89:40) as well as internal alarm (Pr. 10:14). Fear both as an emotion and as a circumstance (not come near) is gone. It is a picture of total, unbroken peace.
15-17, Protected status: the Creator and his servants. The security of the strong city (11-14) is traced to its root in the care of a sovereign Creator God. Never again (as, e.g., 10:5—-15) will he move a punitive attacker against his city (15a), and not only will every hypothetical attacker be foiled of his purpose but that purpose will be reversed in his submission (15b). Why is this?
342
ISAIAH 54:15 — 55:2
Because everything ultimately is part of creation and therefore
under the Creator’s executive control (16). He guarantees his
people’s immunity (17a) — and if we press beyond the weapon
(16) and the attack (17a) to the formulation of a hostile plan
(17b), even there too the Creator is active to secure his people’s
immunity. Behind all this lies what they have inherited and
possess (17c), a particular dignity (servants, 17ac) and standing
(vindication, 17d, or ‘righteousness’).
15-17b. Surrender: (lit.) ‘fall (down) to you’ or ‘come over to
your side’. Danger (weapon) is traced to its source in craftsmanship (coals) and the craftsman (blacksmith), and then beyond
that to the Creator (J who created). The Creator begins all things,
maintains them in being, controls them in operation and guides
them to the destiny he appoints. If this great God were at work
only in the ‘nice’ things, how grim would be our plight in this
menacing world; but he is at work, and in full operational control
of all things. He is God the Creator, alike in charge of the
initiating agent (16a) and the ultimate agent (16d).
17c. Heritage (nah‘ld) does not describe how something was
acquired but rather the reality of possession. Probably we should
see 17cd as applying not only immediately to the blessings of 15—
17b but also broadly to all the blessings arising from the Servant’s work as listed in this chapter. But, in particular, the word
of the Servant creates servants, those with whom, by his saving
work, he shares his dignity. Up to this point in chapters 40ff.,
Isaiah has used ‘servant’ only in the singular; from now on it will
only appear in the plural. The Servant by his saving work creates
servants. According to 53:11 ‘my righteous servant’ provides
righteousness for the ‘many’. The Lord himself now validates
this gift of ‘righteousness’ (not vindication) by affirming that it
comes from me — an emphatic preposition suggesting ‘straight
from my presence’.
The whole world invited into the new world (55:1—13). In
contrast to the particular command to Zion to ‘sing’ (54:1), the
great invitation (lit.) ‘O [not “Come”] all you who are thirsty’
brings before us the worldwide consequences of the Servant’s
work, namely that he was designated to establish ‘justice [revealed truth] on earth’ (42:4) and to be ‘my salvation to the ends
of the earth’ (49:6). What, then, does the saving work in.52:13:—
53:12 offer to the whole world?
1-2, Free provision for every need. The contrasting promises
of waters to drink and the richest of fare (2d) to eat embraces
every need and every necessary supply. The first invitation, Come
to the waters, underlines a life-threatening need and an abundant
343
ISAIAH 55:3-4
supply. The second invitation, come, buy and eat, extended to the
one who has no money, highlights inability and helplessness: on
the one hand, how can one without money buy? But, on the other
hand, nothing can be had without payment (buy). Someone — in
context, by implication, the Servant in his saving efficacy — has
paid the purchase price. The third invitation, Come, buy wine and
milk, without money, stresses the richness of the provision: not
just the water of bare necessity but the wine and milk of
luxurious satisfaction. Isaiah has already pictured the idolater pouring out gold and silver (46:6) in order to “feed on ashes’
(44:20). The antidote to such lack of discernment (44:19; cf
40:18-20, 25), mental delusion (44:20) and pointless labour
(44:12) — what an exposure of religion without revelation! — is to
listen, listen (lit. ‘listen listeningly’): to give full attention to listening and do nothing else at all, to give full and undivided attention to the word of God. It is in this way that the ashes of
false religion are replaced by the richest of fare. 3-5, Co-equal citizenship. The ‘outside world’ is not invited
to a soup kitchen or mere charitable handout. Come (3a) picks up
the illustrative invitation to the banquet (1-2) but moves on from
picture to reality. What is promised to those who hear and come —
that is all they need to do! — is true life (3b), the opposite of the
thirst, hunger and lack of satisfaction of verses 1-2; the security
of a permanent covenant with its promised benefits (3c); in fact,
life under David (3d) to whom world rule was promised (4) and
whose kingdom will prove magnetic (Sab) because of the
attracting presence of the Holy One (Sc-e).
3-4. Come to me: the Lord himself is the promised banquet.
Covenant with you should be ‘covenant for you’. The formula
karat brit I° (e.g. Ps. 89:3) means ‘to inaugurate a covenant in
favour of’, to bring a person into the benefits that the covenant
pledges. The benefits covenanted here are (lit.) ‘the trustworthy
loves’ promised to David. Psalm 89 is the key text explaining this
expression: 89:1 announces the theme, (lit.) ‘the loves of the
Lord’, which finds expression in ‘a covenant for David’ (3);
89:49 concludes the psalm by appealing for the enactment of
these great ‘loves’. The body of the psalm explains why the plural is used: the Lord’s ‘loves’ for David are, first, the love (24) which pledges universal rule (22-27) and, secondly, the love (28) promising David an enduring kingship (28-37). Into this world kingdom, and under the sway of this enduring king, come all who respond to the invitation. Witness (4): David is not elsewhere spoken of as the Lord’s witness, but the idea of worldwide Davidic testimony is rooted in the Davidic psalms (9:11; 18:49;
344
ISAIAH 55:5—7
57:9-11; 108:3-4; 145:21). Psalm 18 affirms that ‘a people I do
not know will serve me’. But if David is nowhere spoken of
plainly as the Lord’s witness, the Servant is (42:1-4; 49:2-3;
50:4), and the function of the present passage is to bring together
the presentations of the Royal Messiah (chs. 1 — 37) and the
Servant Messiah (chs. 38 — 55). All the soul-renewing blessings
of 55:1-3 are to be found within the rule of David because David
and the Servant are the same Person.
5. Because of the LORD (5): the same powerful magnetism is at
work here as in 2:24, a magnetism overcoming all nationalistic
objections to embracing the God and king of another nation
(contrast 16:46). In 49:7, the Lord so endowed his Servant that
kings rose to greet him with respect and princes bowed to
acknowledge his supremacy; here the same enduement adorns the
appointed King, and sure mercies lie waiting in his kingdom for
all who respond to the open invitation.
6-9, The fundamental issue. The key to entering upon sure
and lasting blessing is the simple ‘Come ... come ... come ...
listen, listen ... Give ear and come to me’ (1-3). What is involved
in this simple coming? (a) A recognition of urgency while the day
of opportunity lasts (6); (b) an acknowledgment and renunciation
of sin (7ab) and a return to the God of compassion and pardon
(7cd); and (c) a submission of whatever we think or do to what
the Lord thinks and does (8-9).
6-7. The threefold ‘come’ (to the banquet, 1) and the ‘Listen
... give ear’ and ‘come to me’ (2-3) are now brought to their
specific meaning: Seek ... call ... forsake ... turn. To seek is, as
ever in religious usage (e.g. 8:19), not to look for something lost
but to come with diligence to where the Lord is to be found. It
speaks, therefore, of commitment, determination, persistence in
spiritual concern and in longing for the Lord’s presence and
fellowship. To call is at one and the same time to acknowledge
him in worship (Gn. 13:4; Ps. 105:1) and to appeal to him in need
(Ps. 50:15). Forsake and turn are the two sides of true
repentance, turning from and turning to (1 Thes. 1:9). Wicked (7)
and evil are broad, non-specific words. If any difference is to be
found, the former points more to character and the latter to the ill
effects of sin. Way and thoughts (cf. 8) are respectively ‘lifestyle’
(as when we excuse somebody for being rude by saying, ‘He
doesn’t mean it. It’s just his way’) and the ‘mind’ which lies
behind it, entertaining ideas, fashioning plans. Mercy is “compassion’ (see 54:8). The penitent is embraced in a surge of divine
love. Freely is ‘abundantly’, (lit.) “he will act multiplyingly in
pardon’, as though it were pardon with compound interest.
345
ISAIAH 55:8-11
Pardon (Vsalah; widely used about forty times, e.g. Nu. 14:20; 1
Ki. 8:30, 34) is a word of general meaning: to do whatever must
be done to deal with sin, a word focused on the fact of forgiveness without reference to reason or means.
8-9. The Lord is completely different from humans (vot ...
neither) in what and how he-thinks (thoughts) and in his characteristic ways of action. This is a verse of very wide application,
covering every aspect of life. It cancels the useless and
debilitating question ‘Why?’ in face of life’s difficulties; it opens
the door to the blessed reality of faith in a God who is truly God.
In context its focus is narrower. People would give many dif- ferent answers if questioned about the nature of their need and to
what sort of banquet they would like free access in order to meet
that need. But the Lord is thinking his own thoughts and pursuing
his own road when he meets the moral and spiritual need (spelled out in 6—7). If the words not ... neither seem stark in expressing
the distinction between our thoughts and the Lord’s, this is no
more than is just. How much higher (9) is heaven? The answer is ‘immeasurably’. In relation to any who question the Lord, this comparison cultivates a due humility. In relation to the point at
issue — human moral and spiritual plight - we see the wonder of repentance if it can indeed bridge and cancel such a gap, and how marvellous is the Lord’s remedy.
10-11, The sure word. Verse 10 opens with an explanatory
‘For’. It is logical to question whether the simplicity of ‘Come ...
Listen ... Come to me ... Seek ... call ... forsake ... turn’ can
really and effectively make people right with God. But it is not
repentance that is effective but the word of divine truth.
Rain is a heavenly gift, come down from heaven, designed for
effectiveness (not return ... empty), producing transformation
(watering ... making it bud) and turning deadness into life (seed)
and nourishment (bread). Even so, my word (11) is supernatural
in origin (goes out of my mouth), effective in mission (not return
... empty) and instrumental in achieving what the Lord wills
(what I desire... the purpose for which I sent it). Here, again, is a truth of wide and important application. The Word of God — in our privileged day, the Holy Scriptures — comes from the Lord himself and is the Lord’s chosen instrument to achieve his purposes. The Bible reveals. his thoughts and ways, sets his targets, voices his promises and is powerful to achieve what it expresses. But immediately in this passage the focus is narrower. It speaks particularly of the divine word heard in the call to repentance, the command to come back to God, the promises of compassion and forgiveness. These are effective in achieving
346
ISAIAH 55:12-13
what they say, not because the sinner responds and uses words of
penitence and faith but because God has spoken.
_ 12-13, The promise of a new world. Once more (cf. 10) there
is an initial ‘For’. What the word of God is sent to achieve is a
sure and certain reality, ‘for’ those who respond will find that
they will go out with joy into a world unlike anything they have
previously known (12c-—f), a world transformed (13ab) where
everything is for the Lord’s glory (13c) and which is an eternal
reality (13de).
12. It is typical of the Bible to represent responding to the
Lord as coming to a party (1-2), and this is now expressed in the
joy (12) in the Lord into which his people enter and the peace he
gives (53:5; 54:10). Go out, as at the exodus, from bondage into
liberty, from alienation back, through the Servant’s work (49:5—
6), to God. Led forth, i.e. by the Lord himself (42:16; 52:12; Ex.
13:21-22). The personal transformation — new emotions (joy),
new relationships and expectations (peace), new guardianship
(led) — are matched by a new environment. This is immediately
true in that ‘Heaven above is softer blue, / Earth around is sweeter
green; / Something lives in every hue, / Christless eyes have never
seen’.' But the ultimate reality is the new earth, creation released
from the bondage of corruption to share the liberty of the children
of God (Rom. 8:19-21). The curse has been removed and all
creation explodes in fresh joy (burst into song) and praise (clap).
13. Thornbush (na’*stis; elsewhere only in 7:19) and briers
(sirpad) are both of uncertain meaning. The latter seems to be
related to a verb ‘to wail’ and Isaiah may have invented a
botanical term to reflect the sorrows from which creation has
been released. In any case, the situation is Genesis 3:18 put into
reverse. Pine ... myrtle are likewise uncertain except that they are
evergreens. Death and the curse have been replaced by life and
ever-freshness. For the LORD’s renown: (lit.) ‘this will become a
name for the Lord’. The new exodus community of joy and peace
(12ab) and the exultant (12c-f), transformed (13ab) creation will
themselves speak in revelation of the nature and character of the
Lord: his free invitation, his call to the simplicity of repentance,
his guarantee of compassion and forgiveness, the certainty of his
ways, the power of his word, the move from alienation to
fellowship, from death to life, from the old into the new, from the
transient into the eternal, from need to fullness — such is the Lord
and such what his Servant has done.

ISAIAH 56 — 66
THE BOOK OF THE CONQUEROR (56 — 66)
Some perspective on these chapters can be achieved through a
New Testament parallel. With the birth of Jesus Christ, the
promised King arrived, heir of David’s throne and dominion (Lk.
1:31-33); with his death, the saving work of the Servant was
completed and acknowledged in the threefold exaltation of
resurrection, ascension and heavenly enthronement (Heb. 10:12).
But his kingship is, at present, publicly incognito, and, even
though redeemed, both we and the world we live in are far from
ideal. Its rulers are inadequate, frequently hostile and never free
from sin. There are also, still active, the world rulers of this
darkness (Eph. 6:12). In brief, the King is reigning, the work of
salvation has been done, but the world is in an interim, awaiting
the day when foes will submit (Heb. 10:13), every knee bow
(Phil. 2:9-11) and his people become like him because they see
him as he is (1 Jn. 3:2).
Historically and politically, Isaiah has reached the point
where, thanks to Cyrus, the people have returned from Babylon
(48:20-21), and it is to this situation that he now turns his
prophetic powers. He has alerted them to the fact that they will
return as they went. Prior to the exile the House of David was an
empty husk. Ahaz had sold his sovereignty to the Assyrians and
his successors were but puppet kings. Isaiah foresaw (45:9-13; . 46:8-13) that it would be a point of contention with the exiles
that, on their return, they would still be beholden to a pagan
emperor — no David, no Davidic throne — and therefore, in principle, under the same sort of inadequate, self-seeking local rulers
as in pre-exilic Jerusalem. All the royal promises (9:16; 11:1—9;
32:1—-8; 33:17-24) are true but await realization. Furthermore, the
returning people were warned that ‘there is no peace for the
wicked’ (48:22). Political blessing is one thing, spiritual
transformation another, so that, like us, even those who ‘fain
would serve Thee best/ Are conscious most of wrong within’.!
In drawing this parallel between the Christian’s situation and
Israel’s situation in 539 BC, we have in fact offered a fair
summary of the themes of Isaiah 56 — 66. In the returned community, Isaiah sees a replication of the Jerusalem society he knew — and he uses pre-exilic terms to describe it.> The community,
1 From H. Twells, ‘At even, ere the sun was set’. _ 2From the point of view of literary styles, chs. 56 — 66 are perfectly at home in the Isaianic literature, exhibiting the same genre of rhythmic prose (the style of

ISAIAH 56:1-8
under inadequate leaders (56:9-12), will be spiritually divided
(57:1-2; 59:14-15; 65:11-12) with much evidence of false
religion (57:3—13; 65:3—7) on the one side and a deep sense of sin
(59:1-15) and of spiritual longing (64:1-2) on the other. The
prophet answers this longing by encouraging great expectations:
the Lord himself will intervene (59:16-19; 66:14-16) bringing
healing, peace (57:15-—21) and provision (65:13-16); Zion will
become glorious, the focal point of all the earth (60; 62; 66:7-13,
17-24), the centre of the New Creation (65:17—24). Central to all
as the focal expectation and the sole Agent of the coming
salvation and vengeance is a messianic figure, the anointed
Conqueror (59:20—21; 61:1-3; 61:10 — 62:7; 63:1-6).
X. THE IDEALAND THE ACTUAL: THE LORD’S NEEDY,
UNDER-ACHIEVING PEOPLE (56:1 — 59:13)
This section falls into four parts. The vision of a worldwide,
inclusive ‘Sabbath-people’ (56:1-8), is balanced by the actual
state of the community (56:9 — 57:21), divided, hostile, a mixture
of the ‘righteous’ and compromisers. 58:1—14 returns to the
theme of the Sabbath as the ideal life of the Lord’s people, and
this is balanced by confessions of failure (59:1—13).
a. The waiting people (56:1-8)
The Lord announces a brilliant future: on the one hand it is the
realization of his salvation and righteousness (1), on the other it
is the gathering of scattered Jsrael along with others (8). The
marks of those who set themselves to wait for this day are justice
and what is right (1), perseverance (2ab), Sabbath-keeping (2c)
and separation (2d). They will include the foreigner (3ab, 6-7)
and the eunuch (3cd—5). The pre-exilic people of God was implicitly universal. Exodus 12:48 makes provision for the
conversion of the resident alien; Ruth 2:12 records a Moabite girl
taking refuge under the wings of the God of Israel; and the
Isaiah’s recorded sermons which predominates in 1 — 37) and of high poetry (the
style predominantly found in 38 — 55). Thus, for example, the rhythmic prose of
1:10-20 reappears in 48:1-19 and again in 57:3—10; the high poetry of 2:2-4 or
35:1-10 can be compared with 43:1-3 or 55:1-13 and reappears in the exquisite
61:10 — 62:7, and so on. It is the ‘mixture as before’. The concepts presented in
56 — 66 are plainly pre-exilic. The religious aberrations Isaiah exposes are what
he saw in pre-exilic Judah and are unknown in the post-exile. Like all visionaries,
he furnishes his visions with the existing furniture of his mind, using what he
knows as typifying or providing a motif of what will be — not, in this case,
predicting but diagnosing.
349
ISAIAH 56: 1—2
presence of Isaiah 2:2-4 in Micah 4:1-3 (or vice versa) indicates
the popularity of the thought of a universal people. Isaiah shaped
this universalism into ever-clearer forms. He started with the
typical pre-exilic vision of David’s spreading kingdom (9:7;
11:12-16) but moved on to forecast one world, one people, one
God (19:24~25; 27:12-13). Another forward move came with the
extension of the name ‘Israel’ to this universal people (45:14—25),
and the capstone was put in place in the Servant who brings
revealed truth to the world (42:14), who is salvation to the ends
of the earth (49:6) and who calls all to his banquet (55:1-13) —
hence, here in 56:1-8, the vision of a worldwide, non-exclusive
worshipping community. 1. Justice ... what is right (lit. ‘righteousness’). In the typical
Isaianic combination of ‘judgment and righteousness’ (1:21;
5:16; 9:7; 16:5; 28:17; 32:1, 16), ‘righteousness’ means the
righteous principles of life the Lord has revealed and ‘judgment’
their specific application. Those who model their lives on the
Servant (50:10) ‘pursue righteousness’ (51:1). Some urge that the
concept of ‘doing righteousness’ is different in chapters SO6ff.
from 40 — 55, but examination does not bear this out. Isaiah is not
inviting people to seek salvation by righteous works but calling
them to live the life the Lord has revealed as ‘right’. This is not
offered as a means of salvation but as a characteristic of those
awaiting salvation. My salvation looks back to 49:6; 51:5-6;
52:7, 10, and forward to 59:11, 17; 60:18 (cf 26:1); 62:1. My
righteousness is shorthand for ‘the fulfilment of my righteous
purposes’ (as in 45:8, 23; 46:13; 51:6, 8).
2. This is all typical of biblical ethics: a summons to holiness
(lab), based on knowing what the future holds (lcd), issuing in
present rewards (2ab). Sabbath: some scholars, referring to
Nehemiah 10:31 and 13:15, would see this emphasis on the
Sabbath as evidence of a post-exilic date.' But Isaiah 1:13 and
Amos 8:5 show how punctilious was Sabbath observance in the
pre-exile. Ezekiel 20:12; 22:8, 26, condemn profaning the Sabbath as a pre-exilic sin, and Jeremiah 17:19-27 makes Sabbath
observance a test of obedience to the Lord. Isaiah makes the same point. Acceptance of the Sabbath involves the reorgan- ization of the whole of life in order to accommodate the principle of one day set apart; it is also the Lord’s invitation to his
! G. A. F. Knight states: ‘Actually the ever recurring Sabbath day was the only institution the people possessed that was able to hold them together ... those long fifty years’ (Isaiah 56 — 66 [Eerdmans, 1985], p. 5). This, however, seems a highly dubious understanding of the life of a captive people in a captor country.
350
ISAIAH 56:3-8
covenant people (Ex. 31:16) to enter into his rest (Ex. 23:12;
31:17). There could be no plainer testimony to belonging to the
Lord’s separated people. 3. Foreigner and eunuch are examples of an all-embracing
inclusiveness. The Old Testament was never exclusive on a nationalistic basis. Deuteronomy 23:3ff. dealt with nations requiring
special disciplines but (Ex. 12:48-49) the foreigner was always
in principle welcome. Again Ezra 4:1-3 and Nehemiah 2:19-20
are not jingoism but measures to preserve the distinct people.
Once distinctiveness is lost there is nothing for the outsider to
join! The exclusion of the eunuch (Dt. 23:1) is never explained,
and Isaiah leaves it there because his purpose is not to explain
exclusion but to emphasize incorporation. All middle walls of
partition are down. 4-5. Covenant includes both the pledges which the Lord
makes to his people and the revealed law to which they
responsively bind themselves. Eunuchs are as free as any other
people to enter this sphere of grace. This is another way of expressing co-equal (not second-class) participation. To them the
Lord grants access to his presence (temple ... walls), personal
acceptance (memorial ... name), more than abundant recompense
for deprivations (better than) and eternal security (everlasting ...
not cut off).
6-8. Entrance is open but not unconditional. Bind: there must
be personal decision. Serve ... love (cf: Dt. 10:12, 20) are the
marks of Israelite devotion. The reduplication serve ... worship
(lit. ‘be his servants’) makes the same point: no mere conformism
but commitment to ‘be his servant’. These (7), the formerly
unprivileged (foreigner) and unwelcome (eunuch), are brought by
the Lord to where he is (mountain), to a speaking relationship
with him (prayer), to the ordinances which guarantee acceptance
and atonement (sacrifices ... altar) — and all this not as a concession but a fulfilment of what my house was always intended to
be, for all nations. The order Israel ... others (8) follows 49:6.
Exiles: (lit.) ‘scattered ones’, alluding neither to Babylonian
exile, nor geographical dispersion, but to those scattered from the
Lord (Jn. 11:52). Others: like the foreigners and eunuchs, the
previously unreached and unwelcomed. Besides: better ‘to be’;
Israel and the others all alike brought home to become the Lord’s
one gathered people.
b. The divided people (56:9 — 57:21)
We come down with a bump from the heights of vision to the
grim realities of inadequate leaders (56:9-12) and life at the
ao
ISAIAH 56:9-12
ground level (57:1-21), where there is tension and worse between ‘the righteous’ (1) and those who have apostasized to the
cults (3-13) and forgotten the Lord (11). One group 1s destined
for peace (2, 19), the Lord dwells with them (15) and leads them
home (14); the other he abandons to what help their idols can
give (13) and they know no peace (21).
i. The failure of the leaders (56:9-12). Savagery of imagery
and of style reflects the prophet’s loathing of a major factor in the
loss of the ideal: leaders who are blind and self-seeking. There 1s
a feast in waiting as the beasts close in to devour (9); there is a
feast in progress, the indulgence of self-absorbed rulers (11).
They lack requisite foresight and knowledge (10ab), are as use- less as somnolent watchdogs (10c-f), active only for indulgence
(1lab), shepherds who look after themselves and not the sheep
11)
9. Beasts (cf. Lv. 26:22; Dt. 28:26; 32:24; 2 Ki. 17:25): the
advent of the beasts betokens abandonment of the Lord’s law.
Come: note the inclusio with the same word in verse 12. Isaiah’s
irony is almost frightening: the rulers gather to feast, ignorant
that other guests have been called.
10-12. Watchmen ... shepherds are the twin aspects of true
leadership: to guard from coming danger and care for present
needs (Ezk. 3:16-21; 33:1-9; 34:2-9). Between the picture of
watchmen with no concern for security (10a—d) and thoughtless
shepherds (11\c-e), Isaiah puts his finger on the cardinal sin of the
ruler: insatiable self-concern (10e—11b). It would be laughable
were it not tragic to read side by side watchmen and blind (10a),
dogs and mute (10c). They are unqualified (knowledge), unmotivated (lie around), insatiable (never enough), undiscerning
(understanding, the ability to see to the heart of a thing),
improvident (tomorrow ... better). Life at public expense is a bottomless purse.
ii. The prostitute’s brood and the Lord’s household (57:1— 21). The apparent jumble of this passage reflects the ‘mix’ of life
at ground level in a secular society: the ‘righteous’ having a difficult time (1), people caught up in cults (3-5) and in politics (9-10). Some find God near (15) and live with a peace and confidence not experienced by all (19-21). Yet the verses are not really a jumble but a presentation: the peace enjoyed by the righteous (1-2) contrasts with the lack of peace of the wicked (20-21); the prostitute and her family (3-13) contrasts with the Lord and his household (14-19).
352
ISAIAH 57:1-5
Security, come what may (57:12). It was a society hostile to
true believers — not necessarily irreligious, for often the harshest
opponent of genuine faith is formal ecclesiasticism (Am. 5:12-
13; cf. 5:21-24; 7:10-17). But behind all the malignity a purpose
is at work which no-one ponders ... understands. Devout men:
literally ‘men of unfailing love’, those whom the Lord loves with
a never-failing love. Taken away ... taken away: the first is plural,
the second singular; the general truth followed by the particular
case. It is always the same: the death of the righteous (those right
with God) is never simply the inevitable end that comes to all,
neither is it ever accidental or untimely, but always purposeful,
deliberate, a ‘taking away’ in order to be spared from evil (1 Cor.
10:13; 2 Ki. 22:20) and brought into peace and rest. As they lie in
death: literally ‘they lie upon their beds’, an entering into
comfort. Walk uprightly is the last phrase in the MT, just as the
righteous is the first; those who are ‘right with God’ display an
upright life as others watch them.
The prostitute and her family (57:3-13). The terms of this
passage are taken from pre-exilic cults and are written with such
vigour as to suggest that the cults were in full operation when
Isaiah wrote (see also p. 33). There is no evidence of corresponding post-exilic practices. A prophet in the post-exile could
not have written like this. Isaiah furnishes his vision of the postexile stereotypically with the religious clutter of his own day.
3-5, Parentage and practice. 3-4. But you: in this mixed
society, alongside the ‘righteous’, are those who are unfaithful to
the Lord. Sorceress: one who has opened herself to control by a
spirit or supernatural entity. Adulterers ... prostitutes: adultery,
breaking the marriage covenant, is figurative of reneging on
loyalty; prostitution is entering upon an illicit relationship,
figurative of giving loyalty.' Mocking ... sneer ... tongue (4): they
practised a mounting tide of rejection of the Lord, from poking
fun to scornful sneer and vulgar repudiation. Brood of rebels ...
offspring of liars: ‘born of rebellion ... seed of falsehood’. The
‘rebellion’ is the adulterer who has repudiated a sworm
obligation; the ‘falsehood’ is the prostitute whose whole life is a
lie. To turn from the Lord, then, is wilful disobedience, departure
from the truth to the lie (2 Tim. 4:3-4).
5. Isaiah selects two leading aspects of Canaanite religion:
first, the fertility cult, with its evergreen ‘ree, symbolic of
1 Harlotry as a metaphor occurs about 43 times in the OT. Cf. Ezk. 16:23ff. It
is most deeply diagnosed in the book of Hosea. Cf Is. 1:21; 23:15-17. There is no
evidence of harlotry being levelled as a charge post-exile.
353
ISAIAH 57:6-8
undying life (1:29; Dt. 12:2; 1 Ki. 14223-Je: 2:20), and its sexual
rites, prompting the god to fertilize land, animals and humans.
Today, this takes the form of reliance on whatever seems to
secure economic prosperity. For the Canaanite, the ‘religious’ use
of sexuality was a necessary factor in securing the agricultural
economy; for the Bible, such practices were not hallowed by
being ‘religious’: they were Just, the satisfaction of the worshipper replacing the will of God. Secondly, there was the even darker, more repulsive side to Canaanite religion: Molech and human sacrifice (2 Ki. 23:10; Je. 32:35), children burnt alive as
a charm against death, propitiating the god of the underworld.
Again, this acquires no sanctity by being done in the name of
religion. It is (lit.) ‘slaughtering, butchering’, treating babies like
cattle. 6-13, The ways of the mother. Isaiah, using second-person
singular feminine verbs, moves from the family (3-5) to the
mother, the prostitute herself, and offers a diagnosis of what
Hosea (4:12; 5:4) calls ‘the spirit of prostitution’. The Hebrew
here has a manic quality reflecting a person driven by a demon,
now this way, now that, frantic for security — into the valley (6),
up the mountain (7), deep to Sheol (9), paying any price (7-9) for
worldly safety — and all the time (13ef) it was there, without cost,
in the Lord.
6. What is the significance of smooth? Some find in the word heleq a link with Ugaritic, meaning ‘dead gods’.' It is more
typical of Isaiah that the word means ‘slippery’ so that, in one
move, he exposes the stupidity (stones) and duplicity (‘slippery’)
of false religion, but there is one further twist: portion is a word
with the same spelling. What a folly then to swap the Lord (Ps.
16:5; 119:57) for stones!
7-8. From valley bottoms to mountaintops, the spirit of
prostitution fills the whole land. The bed on a hill pictures blatant
immorality. Behind your doors ... doorposts ... pagan symbols:
this whole phrase defies certainty. ‘Symbol’ is zikkarén, ‘memorial’. It occurs with a possessive only in Job 13:12, meaning ‘your memories’; but why should memories be behind the door? Or zikkarén may be related to zakar, ‘male’, and used of some sort of sexual symbol; but again, why behind the door? NIV seems to understand zikkardn as ‘what reminds you’, the symbols typifying the apostate paganism. Is the meaning, then, that they practised paganism ‘behind the door’ while publicly professing true religion? But Isaiah has been stressing the blatant
1 Young, Studies in Isaiah, pp. 402-403.
354
ISAIAH 57:9-10
publicizing of apostasy. More likely ‘your reminders’ has a good
meaning: the writing up of the Lord’s words on the doorposts
(Dt. 6:9) as a public declaration of faith and a constant recall to
basics. But now the sin of compromise hides the traditional
profession behind the door! Uncovered ... climbed into ... opened
wide: they publicized their immorality, paraded themselves as
available and made room for all comers. Made a pact with: (lit.)
‘made a covenant for you from them’, bargained for what was
most advantageous for themselves at others’ expense. But the
covenant lay at the heart of their relationship with the Lord (cf
56:4, 6); to make another covenant violates fidelity. The pact
emphasizes the financial motive, but there was more: whose beds
you love, i.e. money apart, the heart was given to another. Looked
on their nakedness: literally ‘you saw a hand’. There is no
evidence for ‘hand’ as the sexual organs. ‘Hand’ symbolizes personal resources, including financial. In Leviticus 25:26 ‘acquires
sufficient means’ is literally ‘his hand overtakes’. Before sealing
the pact, the prostitute prudently appraises her clients’ finances!
‘Hand’ is also used of a memorial stone (1 Sa. 15:12; 2 Sa.
18:18), securing remembrance. ‘You saw a hand’ could mean
‘you saw a chance of achieving lasting fame’. This suits the
security theme (see 9-10) — as for example in Hezekiah’s lunatic
delusions of grandeur in the alliance with Merodach-Baladan
(39:1-8).
9-10. The metaphor of prostitution is explained. For Molech
read the king (NIV mg.). Israel ‘prostituted herself’ (apostasized
from the Lord, gave her loyalty to others) to secure military
‘clout’, to have the ‘great powers’ on her side (cf: Ezk. 16, 23).
The background here is chapters 7 and 28 — 31 (cf. 2 Ki. 16:10-
20) when Judah flirted disastrously with Assyria (‘the king’) and
Egypt (ambassadors; cf. 30:1-7). Grave: ‘Sheol’, used in 28:14—
15 to expose the stupidity of the politicians who returned from
Egypt crowing over their success. It does not refer, here or there,
to seeking strength through supernal powers but to the fact that
signing covenants with the nations is signing their own death
warrant. You went: literally ‘you descended’, i.e. abased yourself
below your dignity as the Lord’s people, the dignity of faith in
such a God, to the demeaning work of currying worldly favours.
And somehow, when the demon of a do-it-yourself salvation
grips people, though evidence mounts that it is a burden we do
not have strength to bear (10a), an unachievable goal (10b), there
always seems to be strength for one more try (10cd)!
In verses 11-13, Isaiah rounds off his diagnosis of false
religion — the religion of disloyalty (3-6) and frenzied pursuit of
355
ISAIAH 57:11-13
alternative salvation (7-10) — by pointing out the awesomeness of
a God who is to be feared (11a—d), the people’s misunderstanding
of a God who is patient (11e—-12), the justice of a God who gives
us the consequences of our own choices (13ab), and the ultimate
contrast between the impermanence of human schemes of
security and the inheritance that comes through trust (13c-f).
11. Unbelief is, first, groundless: what is more to be feared
than the Lord (11a)? Secondly, it is sinful (11b): been false, “tell
lies’, in this case to affirm that the Lord is our God but, in
practice, to withhold the reverence due to him and give it to
others. Thirdly, it is inexcusable (11c): to forget all the former
mercies, the great acts of the Lord, and to use his name — the very
thing he wished to be remembered by (Ex. 3:15) — and yet to
forget him! Fourthly, it is insulting (11d): pondered this in your
hearts, (lit.) simply ‘laid to heart’, meaning ‘gave me a thought’,
the practical atheism of living without the Lord. Long been silent:
hasG for the most part means inactivity rather than silence, and
this must be the meaning here. The people of God were never
without the voice of God through the prophets and in the law. Yet
Gideon was able to ask, ‘Where are all his wonders that our
fathers told us about?’ (Jdg. 6:13). Why is God doing nothing?
Such apparent inactivity begets misunderstanding (Ps. 50:21),
and leads to moral and spiritual complacency. But of what period
could it be said that the Lord was inactive while his people
pursued other gods and sought salvation in alliances? Certainly
not in the post-exile, where these sins were absent; certainly not
in the exile, since it was itself the act of God in judgment; only in
the pre-exile could people look back on a long tenure of their
privileges, shrug off prophetic warnings and assume divine
inactivity. In no other period could this message have originated.
Here, as throughout chapters 56 — 66, Isaiah is seeing post-exilic
Israel with pre-exilic eyes and using his existing oracles to
address a future generation. But considerations of date are far less
important than what the prophet is saying: the people of God are
called to live by the word of God — the record of past acts which
abidingly declares what he is; the divine law, infallibly directing:
life’s pathway, inspired messages already vouchsafed, enshrining
unchanging truth. It is these things that beget and perpetuate that et (11f) of the Lord which excites obedience, faith, loyalty and oliness. 12-13. People can drift very far indeed from the Lord and still assume that they are ‘right’ with him (righteousness) and that what they do (works) is acceptable to him. The day of the Lord’s judgment — including the final judgment (Rev. 20:12) — is simply
356
ISAIAH 57:14-15
that he will expose all this. Expose is ‘I will declare’. To hear the
voice of God reading out the catalogue of works in which people
have trusted is to see through them: they will not benefit. There is
nothing more dreadful than that the Lord should leave us to the
mercy of our own choices! When you cry out: literally ‘shriek’.
This is the first hint of the coming divine judgment, central to
these chapters. That day will declare the worthlessness of every
alternative object of trust (2:20; 31:7). Idols: with this word
Isaiah brings the first part of his presentation full circle. It is no
accident that he can move so easily from false religious practice
(3-6) to the picture of advertising for lovers (7-8) and the reality
it pictured, seeking international alliances (9-10). Turning from
the Lord, where else is security to be sought than in the logical
exercises of power politics? But all this is so fragile that it is
threatened by wind, destroyed by a mere breath. The politicians
had no time for Isaiah’s remedies (28:7—13) — kindergarten stuff,
they called it. They refused to shelter trustfully in him (makes me
his refuge). But this is the faith that brings security: permanent
tenure (inherit the land), access to the Lord’s presence, certainty of his goodwill, and care and blessing (possess my holy
mountain).
The Lord and his family (57:14-21). This passage, concerned with the Lord’s gracious care of his household, picks up
and develops the thoughts implicit in verse 1-2. There the
righteous move out of hostility into peace; here the opening
thought is the road (home) and the concluding thought guidance
into peace (18-19).
14. In 40:3 the road was prepared for the Lord to come to
rescue his people; here it is an uncluttered way by which they
travel (35:1-10): a causeway (build up) and therefore unmissable; free of obstacles and therefore those who use it cannot but
reach their destination. They are my people, and the for with
which verse 15 begins heralds an explanation of the road, the
travellers and the destination.
In verses 15-19 Isaiah introduces the divine Speaker (15ab)
who purposes to share his home (15c-f). There are three aspects
of this favoured company: the end of accusation (16), anger
replaced by healing (17—18a), the bestowal of comfort and peace
(18b-19). ;
15. The Lord speaks of himself (15ab), his home (15c), his
household (15d), his purpose of renewal and the characteristics of
his family (15ef). High and lofty: as in 6:1; 52:13, respectively
what the Lord is in himself and what he is in relation to all else.
Lives for ever: as ‘father of eternity’ in 9:6 means ‘eternally
357
ISAIAH 57:16-18
a father’, so here ‘inhabiter of eternity’ means ‘eternally the
inhabitant’. The word Vsakan (Ex. 25:8; 29:45) is used of the
Lord coming to dwell among his people and, just as at the exodus
the Lord gathered his people to himself by redemption (Ex. 6:6—
7) with the deliberate purpose of dwelling among them (Ex.
29:42-46), so now he purposes.exactly the same but on an eternal
scale (cf, 33:5, 16). High ... holy: again as at the exodus, the Lord
purposes that his people should be gathered to him without any compromise to his transcendence and holiness; this implies some provision equivalent to that of the levitical sacrifices whereby a sinful people could come near to God, and, in the context of
Isaiah’s book, this can only point to the levitical / priestly work of
the Servant (52:13-53:12). Whether contrite, literally ‘crushed’, ie. under life’s burdens, oppositions or whatever, or /ow/ly, at the
bottom of life’s heap, whether in their own estimation (1 Tim.
1:15) or that of the world (1 Cor. 4:9-10), it is not the Lord’s intention to leave his people thus but rather to revive, to give
(new) being to, in spirit and heart. When used together like this,
spirit is the ability to enter into life with gusto, and heart is
the interior capacity for true thought, pure delight, accurate reflection.
16. The initial For (omitted, NIV) makes this verse an
explanation. How will the Lord thus introduce people into the
high and holy dwelling? First, by satisfying his own legal
requirements (accuse, lit. ‘engage in legal proceedings’) and | bringing to an end his own anger (nor ... always be angry). Were
this not to happen, it would mean the end of all living things
(grow faint, lit. ‘faint away’). How it will happen Isaiah has no
need to say, because he is speaking against the background of the
Servant’s work of satisfaction. But his point is not to explain how
but to affirm shat the Lord intends to bring people into his
household, by satisfying his just law and his holy nature.
17-18. These verses respectively match Genesis 6:5-7 and 8.
An unbroken human history of sinful greed — ‘the iniquity’
(perverseness, crookedness) of an unscrupulous pursuit of selfinterest — roused anger (enraged) and provoked hostility (punished, ‘smote’) and alienation (hid my face) but to no good effect
(kept on, lit. ‘backsliding in the -way of his heart’). A further and different work of God is needed but not obligatory, and Genesis 6:8 rightly defines it as a work of grace (NIV ‘favour’): here a true diagnosis, J have seen; an effective remedy, heal; a new lifestyle, guide; and a different relationship with the Lord, restore comfort. The latter means (lit.) ‘fulfil comforts to him and to his mourners’: to ‘fulfil comforts’, “give comfort in full and plenty’,
358
ISAIAH 57:19-21
betokens a new attitude on the Lord’s part, a change from anger
to loving concern; ‘and to his mourners’ betokens the meeting
of human needs, the application of the comfort where it is
consciously needed. 19. The explanation of what the Lord purposes to do to
achieve the vision of verse 15 continues. Creating: there will be a
new creative act, the Lord doing what only the Lord can do (see
on 4:5): in particular he will create the capacity to respond
verbally. Praise on the lips ... Israel is not a translation but an
attempted explanation. The sequence in Isaiah’s Hebrew is ‘give
complete comfort to him and to his mourners as I create the fruit
of the lips’ (no reference to Israel). The Lord will enable the
mourners to say whatever it is appropriate for these mourners to
say, ie. to use their newly-created gift of speech in repentance
and contrition. Thus they come into peace, peace. The duplication (see 6:3) means peace in its full reality and nothing but
peace. Heal: i.e. bring into that complete wholeness that peace
implies. 20-21. In contrast to ‘the righteous’ (1), here are the wicked.
This typical biblical pairing is specially relevant to this section of
Isaiah which focuses on the balancing ideas of salvation and
vengeance (59:17; 61:2; 63:4-6). The righteous are those who are
‘right with God’ and acquitted before his tribunal; the wicked are
those who are pronounced guilty. Tossing: better ‘disturbed’;
subject to disordering forces from outside, but at the same time
within itself ill at ease (cannot rest), at odds in its own nature,
lacking the ability to become integrated, and a source of
corruption (mire and mud). No peace: cf. 48:22, where those
without peace were the returnees from Babylon, still needing the
Servant’s work to bring them home to the Lord; here, in contrast
to the righteous brought into their eternal home (1-2), the wicked
are, as Isaiah will show, on their way to wrath and judgment.’
c. The Sabbath people (58:1-14)
Isaiah now embarks on a second contrast. In chapters 56 — 57
he contrasted the inclusive unity of the Lord’s Sabbath people
(56:1-8) with the inadequacies and divisions of the actual community (56:9 — 57:21). Here he contrasts the true Sabbath life
(58:1—14) with their actual, disconsolate awareness of themselves
(59:1-13). As he shows, true Sabbath-keeping demands con1 On the place of 57:21 in seeking to analyse the Isaianic literature, see on
51:10-11 with n.1 (pp. 323-324); also p. 320 n.1.
ga9
ISAIAH 58:1-4
secrating one’s timetable to God (cf Ex. 16:22-30; Nu. 15:32-
36), but (see esp. 13-14) the Sabbath is also a test whether the
heart delights in God. Within the Isaianic literature, chapter 58
belongs with 1:10-20, in condemnation both of the ‘unholy
alliance’ between religious punctiliousness and personal and
social indiscipline, and of a religion that assumes a relationship
with God while discounting a relationship with other people. In
structure, rebuke (1) is matched by promise (14); the fast without
blessing (2-5) is balanced by the feast with blessing (13—14a);
and the central verses (6-12) expound the Lord’s chosen fast and
the enrichments it brings. 1. The call to acknowledge rebellion looks back to 57:19,
where it is the gift of repentance that marks those at peace with
God, and looks forward to 59:1-13, where we meet people
acknowledging sin and need. Thus it is the proclamation of his
word that the Lord uses to create responsiveness (Rom. 10:17).
Rebellion ... sins: in Jeremiah 17:19-27 the Sabbath is the test of
obedience; here its misuse is a cardinal sin.
In verses 2-5, the initial For introduces this whole paragraph
as an explanation of the accusation of ‘rebellion’ and ‘sins’ (1).
To all outward appearance there is a committed practice of
religion (2) in which they approach God (2a) and want him to
approach them (2f). But (with correct interpretation) NIV says that
there is a seem and an as if about it all. This is spelt out as the
prophet exposes their motivations (3a—d), their behaviour (3ef)
and the outcome of their fast (4ab). It is mere outward show (Sa—
d), unacceptable to the Lord (Sef).
2. Assiduous (day after day), committed (seek, 31:1; 55:6),
spiritual (me is emphatic), eager (lit. ‘are delighted to’) — to all
appearance a model of spiritual reality, and of ambition to know
and to do my ways ... right ... commands. Eager for God to come
near: literally ‘for the nearness of God’. The verbs ‘to come near’
and ‘to bring near’ are the characteristic verbs of the levitical
system in which sacrifices were ‘brought near’ and thereby
worshippers enjoyed the nearness of God. This is indeed model
religion: God-centred (2a), with concern for truth a priority,
together with the lifestyle that accords with the truth (2b-d),
living by the word of God (2e), and using the ordinances as true means of grace (2f).
34. But there was a fatal flaw: it was all done in the pharisaic spirit of Luke 18:12. What seemed like eager devotion was actually aimed at earning benefit (3a—d). Not only so, but what was a day off for the employer was a day of exploitation for the employee (3ef). We are not told how this worked out, only that
360
ISAIAH 58:5—9b
what was a as you please on the one side was pain on the
other: exploit (Vndgas), the taskmasters’ verb (Ex. 3:7); workers,
a noun (otherwise unused) from V‘dsab, to be in pain — toilsome
work, sweated labour. Moreover, every fast day ended in a fight.
Fasting was intended to win divine approval, but it brought out
the worst in people — understandable if a basically unspiritual
family was forced to spend a hungry day together!
5. This was the problem: nothing went beyond conformism,
doing the right actions in the right way. Like a reed exposes the
total formalism of the whole day; their very act of self-abasement
was as meaningless as a reed nodding in the wind. This is not, of
course, to say that there is not a proper use of bowing low before
God and of the disciplined self-humbling of sackcloth (Ne. 9:1).
Humans are a body-soul unity, and these things can be bodily
aids to spiritual reality (just as fasting has the effect of giving a
purer detachment of mind to seek God), but no ‘aid’ is immune
from degenerating into a performance. Verses 6-12, describing how a fast day should be used, fall
into two parts, each specifying activities (6-7, 9c-10b) and
promising blessings (8—9b, 10c—12). First, a fast day is for the
creation of a caring society (6), meeting needs (7a—c) and family
welfare (7c), and it brings consequent personal blessings: new
beginnings (8a), personal restoration (8b), security (8cd) and a
free-flowing relationship with the Lord (9ab). Secondly, a true
fast is for correction of inhuman conditions (9c), banishing
mischief-making (9d) and meeting needs (10ab), and it results in
clear guidance in life’s perplexities (10cd—1la), renewal (11b),
durability (11c), ever-fresh resources (1lde), restoration and
continuance (12). What seems like deprivation — fasting — is
actually enrichment when used according to God.
6-7. Chains ... cords: time made free by being set apart in
fasting should be used to correct every way in which social
structures or wrongdoers within society destroy or diminish the
proper liberty of others. Untie ... yoke: to eliminate every way in
which social mismanagement treats people like animals. Break ...
yoke: it is not enough to untie; action must be taken to see that
such bondage cannot ever be repeated. Work on the structures of
society (6) must be matched by personal care for the individual
(7) — the hungry, the homeless and the unclad. Provide ... with
shelter (lit. ‘bring ... home’): as food is shared, so is the home
opened. When you see: immediacy of response to known need.
Your own flesh and blood: it is possible to be socially clearsighted and domestically shortsighted.
8-9b. Then: get the fast right and the Lord will respond in
361
ISAIAH 58:9c—12
blessing! He will give, first, a fresh beginning, like a new dawn.
Secondly, personal restoration, the healing of wounds and
disabilities from the past: healing (“riikd) is used of new flesh
growing over a wound (Je. 30:17) and of ‘repair work’ (Ne.
4:12). Thirdly, he will give security with righteousness as a
protective advance guard and glory as a rearguard (52:12). The
Lord provides righteousness (53:11; 54:17) and the believer
wears it as an armour (Rom. 13:12; 2 Cor. 6:7). The glory of the LorpD is the personal presence of the Lord in all his glory, his presence in every place (6:3); here, his guardianship of his own. Fourthly, a free mutuality of relationship with the LORD: unfettered prayer, prompt response. The Lord (9a) is emphatic, ‘the
Lord himself’, his personal attention to our cry. And he will say:
the construction here (a co-ordinate verb) suggests ‘at once he
will say’: Here am I: literally ‘Behold me’, the response of a
waiting, obedient servant (Gn. 22:1, 11; 1 Sa. 3:4). Answered prayer is not like the sending of a food parcel; it is like a home
visit by the doctor. Verses 9c—12 specify the second series of principles with their
consequent blessings (cf 6—9b).
9c-10b. Do away with the yoke (of oppression is an NIV
addition) recapitulates verse 6, but possibly there ‘injustice’
points to burdensome, enslaving social structures, whereas here
the following pointing finger suggests personal behaviour, the
way we can so easily be a bind and burden others. Pointing finger
is not found elsewhere, but Proverbs 6:12-14 shows that
“motions with his fingers’ means acting by hint and innuendo, the
nod or wink in the right place, ‘putting the knife in’, the destructive sneer and the unattributable ‘leak’. It is possible to have
a very developed dutifulness (6) but to be personally malicious
and mischief-making (9). Spend yourselves on: literally ‘grant
your soul to’; since ‘soul’ (nepes) can mean ‘desire, want’, the
words could mean ‘give to the needy what you want for
yourself’, a determined, self-sacrificing commitment going even beyond verse 7.
10c-12. Light: the first blessing here is clarity in life’s darknesses and perplexities. Light is not related to ‘dawn’, as in verse 8, but to darkness, those occasions when we do not know which way to turn, when troubles close in around us. Guide interprets the imagery of light in darkness. Our experience may well continue to be darkness, and we step falteringly into it as best we know, but the reality is divine guidance; he does not suffer our foot to slip (Ps. 121:3). The second promised blessing is of timely supply: sun-scorched (11b) is found only here, but is
362
ISAIAH 58:13—14
related to Vsahah, ‘to be white’ (La. 4:7); hence the adjective
‘bare’ (Ezk. 24:7), ‘unprotected’ (or ‘exposed’, Ne. 4:13). We are
not told what satisfaction the Lord will give but when and where
he will give it — when everything seems bleak, when we are
vulnerable. In such a time he will strengthen your frame, give
durability in the face of harsh demands. Thirdly, there is the
blessing of fresh, incoming resource and vitality, like water
brought for the garden (11d), but, balancing the ministry of the
watering-can, there is the spring, an unfailing internal fountain
(lle; Jn. 4:13). Fourthly come the blessings of restoration
(rebuild, 12) and continuance (Dwellings), recovery from past
disaster (ancient ruins), provision for future secure living (Walls
... Streets). This could, of course, refer to building and restoration
work after the return from Babylon but, alongside the pictures of
light (10), the traveller in the sun-scorched land (11) and the
garden (11), this too is more likely to be a picture, but highly
relevant to Isaiah’s community which knew the devastations
described in 1:6-9.
13-14. In the structure of this poem, verses 13—14a are the
feast with a blessing, matching the fast without a blessing in 2-5,
and verse 14b-d is a promise, matching the rebuke of 1; but the
verses also form a third Jf ... then series, i.e. keep a true Sabbath
and blessings will follow. The Lord is more concerned with the
enjoyment of his blessings through obedience to his commands
than in self-imposed deprivations. In 13a—d, Isaiah emphasizes
positive recognition of the dignity of the Sabbath as holy and
honourable, and in 13ef the protection of the Sabbath from
improper activities. Keep your feet from breaking: (lit.) “turn back
your foot from’, equivalent to ‘watch your step’, take a
thoughtful approach to how you use the day. It is not a ‘free-forall’, a day for doing as you please, yet it is an ‘exquisite delight’
as the lexicons translate delight (6neg). Isaiah deals in principles,
not directives: what is done on the Lord’s day must recognize that
it is a holy and special day; it must be conducive to finding true
delight; it is not a matter of personal preference (going your own
way) or indulgence (doing as you please). Speaking idle words is
‘speaking a word, talking talk’. The expression in Deuteronomy
18:20 means a word without divine authorization, a merely
human word, here ‘chit-chat’. Then: an emphatic conjunction as
in verses 8-9, of one thing assuredly following another. True
Sabbath-keeping brings delight in the Lord. Find your joy 1s a
reflexive form of the verb which yielded the noun delight in verse
13c: ‘bring exquisite delight to yourselves’. In addition, we will
ride on the heights, rise above earthly difficulties, enjoy an
363
ISAIAH 59: 1-4
uplifted life (Dt. 32:13; 33:29; Hab. 3:19) and enter into the
sufficiency and provision (feast) that the Lord has for us,
including all his past promises and covenanted mercies (your
father Jacob).
d. The guilty people (59:1—13)
Following in sequence from 58:1—14, the charges continue (59:1—
8), but now they are met by an admission of guilt and helplessness (59:9-13). Within this broad division the passage
consists of accusations (I—4b, couched in second-person plural
verbs), descriptions (the third-person plural verbs of 5—7) and confessions (the first-person plural of 9-12). Verses 4cd, 8 and 13
are concluding summaries.
i. Accusations (59:1—4). Verses 1-2 reply to the complaint in
58:3-4 of divine inattention in spite of every effort to catch the
Lord’s eye. The problem is not his inattention but our sin. Verses
3—4 spell out the sins which have averted the Lord’s face.
1-3. Arm, literally ‘hand’, the symbol of personal action; ear,
ability and willingness to hear. It is not that he possessed the
power but did not hear, nor that he heard but lacked the power.
The problem is iniquities ‘causing separation’ and sins causing
alienation. He certainly can hear but will not. Face: the Lord is
personally offended and alienated; so to speak, it shows in his
face. You ... from you: it is not only the sin but also the sinner
who drives the Lord away. Will not hear is expressed as an
absolute statement, totally ruling out a possibility of hearing . Sin
alienates him personally (face) from us personally (you) on a
permanent basis. Hands (3): not the word in verse 1 (yad) but
kap, the palm or grip of the hand; a specific accusation of involvement, gripping, holding on to. Fingers: direct, detailed
touch (2:8; 17:8). Stained is ‘defiled’, sin leaving a mark which
remains visible to God; blood, violence done to others (1:15).
Guilt: ‘iniquity’ as in verse 2, the inner corruption and perversion
from which all wrongdoing flows. Lips ... tongue: duplication for
the sake of emphasis, every aspect of speech. The only other
reference to lips in Isaiah is 6:5; on tongue, see 3:8; 32:4; 35:6; 57:14. Lies (Seger), specific falsehoods; wicked things (‘aw‘la), a broader word, ‘deviancy’, untrustworthiness, both what is not right and what is not seemly. As in 6:5, sins of speech come first in the catalogue of importance (cf, e.g., Lv. 19:11; Jb. 5:21; Pr. 12:14; 22:21; Mt. 5:37; 12:36-37; 15:18). 4. The first two lines (4ab) continue the catalogue of what offends the Lord. Calls for justice, or ‘proclaim righteousness’,
364
ISAIAH 59:5—7
probably refers to taking a public stand for what is right; cf
Amos 5:13, where prudence dictates silence. Both prophets have
the same situation in mind — a society hostile to taking a moral
stand. Pleads his case: the reference is not to corruption on the
bench but to misuse of the legal process for illegal ends. The final
two lines (4cd) are differently expressed (infinitives absolute) as
broad sketches of current situations: ‘Reliance on emptiness and
speaking valuelessness, conceiving mischief and bringing forth
trouble.” Empty arguments is tohii (24:10), what lacks stability
and sense. Isaiah is not describing but diagnosing. They may
think they are acting sensibly but actually it is all nonsense: to all
appearance they have reached a thought-out position — trust the
government, trust armed strength, trust alliances, trust the
fundamental instincts of people of goodwill — but the fact is that
all trust, except that reposed in the Lord, is trusting tohd, the
unstable. Lie: the word in verse 3 is specific falsehood (Seger),
but saw’ here means the spirit of unreliability, the whole ethos of
disregard for the truth.
ii. Descriptions (59:5-8). This is an objective, third-person
statement of the situation, made both figuratively (5—6b) and in
reality (6c—7), with a summary (8).
5-6b. Who are they? Probably an indefinite is intended, as
when we report that ‘they say’ or ‘everybody thinks’. Taking a
broad view of society and its members, then, they produce what
is harmful to others (hatch the eggs of vipers), a thought
developed in 5cd; they produce what is useless to themselves
(spin ... web), a thought developed in 6ab. Eats ... is broken are
the contrasting relationships of fellowship and opposition. There
is something about sinful humans which is a constant potential
menace to others and makes all efforts ultimately ineffective for
any good purpose. Eggs ... adder: what starts bad always gets
worse. Cannot cover: sinners are unable to satisfy their own true
longings and needs; their best efforts leave them unsatisfied
(useless) and unprovided for (cannot cover).
6c—7. Typically Isaiah now explains his metaphors: whatever
they do (hands), wherever they go (feet), whatever they think
(thoughts) they cannot escape the contagion of what they are.
Evil deeds, ‘works of trouble-making’; violence, disruptive
behaviour (hamds, 53:9). Rush to sin is ‘run to wrong’, prone to
wrong objectives, wrong actions. /nnocent: those who have done
nothing to deserve what they received. Thoughts: the way we
appraise things, the conclusion we reach when we add everything
up, thoughts leading to formulating plans. Evil: as in 6b, ‘trouble365
ISAIAH 59:8-10
making’. Ruin (s6d), a general word for wreaking ‘havoc’;
destruction is specifically ‘breaking’. Together the words comprise everything that promotes the breakdown of standards and of
society, or threatens what is ordered and stable. :
8. In this general comment (like 4cd) on what has been said,
peace ... peace is the bracketing idea. They do not know peace
(8a) nor can their lifestyle (walks) lead to peace. This is peace in
its most comprehensive sense: peace with God, peace in society,
peace in a mature personality no longer at war with itself. Justice:
at base there is no submission to God’s ‘judgment’, what he has authoritatively decided to be right; but in the broader sense also
there is no setting up of what is right and just — for themselves,
for other people, for society as an entity — as the objective at
which their paths aim. Indeed, to the contrary, they have turned them into crooked roads, literally ‘they have twisted their paths
for themselves/to their own hurt’. There has been a deliberate adoption of crooked/tangled paths, and in them they will meet
sin like a boomerang coming home.
iii. Confessions (59:9-13). The change in these verses is
marked by first-person plural verbs. The secret work of divine enabling (57:19) and the proclamation of God’s law (58:1—14) have
brought the people to the place where they acknowledge the
darkness (9), helplessness (10), bitterness (1lab), hopelessness
(11cd) and guiltiness (12) of sin. The grave problems revealed in
the accusatory (1-4) and descriptive (S—8) sections are not to be ~ laid at the door of ‘society’ or deprivation or whatever; they are
the outward manifestation of us (9) in our personal sinfulness. Verse 13 has the same distinct grammatical forms (infinitives
absolute) as verse 4c, and in the same way provides a concluding summary.
9-10. Justice ... righteousness: see 56:1, where the Lord
summoned his people to a life of justice, or ‘judgment, a life
conformed to the Lord’s decisions’ (42:1, 3-4), and promised the
coming fulfilment of his purposes of righteousness. But the
standards of revealed truth and the life that accords with it are
beyond us, and the promised righteous salvation has not yet come. Inwardly and all around we look for (‘wait expectantly, hope for’, 40:31) light, but all is (lit. ‘Behold’) darkness. The illustration Isaiah chooses shows what this darkness is: the darkness of personal blindness (10). We may very well live in a ‘dark’ world, but the darkness that first calls for rectification is within. Whatever external conditions may be like — midday or twilight — it makes no difference. The darkness is in ourselves;
366
ISAIAH 59:11-13
we are like the dead (14:9-12). The world around seems to be
full of the strong, but we grope as those who cannot see where
they are going, stumble as those who cannot be relied upon for
constancy and stability, and are dead as to the vitality we need to
live the godly life.
11. This verse rounds off the first section of confession: note
how justice ... deliverance (‘salvation’) matches ‘justice ...
righteousness’ (9); and cf again 56:1. Growl is an angry growl
(5:29-30), the anger of believers at the havoc caused by sin. (Cf
the holy groaning of Jesus, Mk. 7:34 and Jn. 11:38; the groaning
of a frustrated creation in which we share, Rom. 8:22—23.) Moan
. like doves: as 38:14, where Hezekiah labours under the
sentence of death and longs for life. Justice: cf 9. Deliverance
should be ‘salvation’ (as 56:1), the rescuing, transforming work
of God.
12. Isaiah, master of drama, has used blindness (10), bears and
doves (11) illustratively. Finally, he presents a court scene, with
sin as the prosecutor and the Lord (in your sight, lit. ‘before you’)
as judge. We may labour under sin’s disabilities (10), lament its
hurts and frustrations (11), but these pale into insignificance
before the reality of divine judgment and the sentence of the law.
Offences, ‘wilful rebellions’, and sins, specific lapses, are known
to God (in your sight), active in our condemnation (against us)
and an ever-present reality (with us). We acknowledge: this is
simply the bowing of the consciously guilty head, the ‘yes’ of the
burdened conscience. The same word is the key to blessed
repentance and cleansing in Psalm 51:3.
13. As in verse 4, infinitives are used here to pass generalizing
comments; also, as in 4, sins of speech are specified and the
metaphor of conception employed. The divine judge of verse 12
is not a detached outsider brought in to hear a case; he is also the
offended party: against the LORD. Rebellion, the wilful refusal of
his way, cf, 12; treachery, deceitfulness, falsity and dissimulation
in our pledges of loyalty. Backs on our God: literally ‘from
(following) after’. Jeremiah 2:2 uses the picture of a new bride
lovingly going along with her husband — but now this has been
reversed. There is no longer the love that keeps company and the
devotion that accepts leadership. Fomenting is ‘speaking’ and,
along with (lit.) ‘the conceiving and uttering from the heart words
of a lie’, it not only gives sins of speech their proper biblical
importance but makes the tongue the index of the heart (Mt.
12:34). Conceived: the sinner cannot admit faulty conduct but
plead purity of heart: it was the heart which ‘conceived’ all that
later came to birth.

ISAIAH 59:14-18
XI. THE PROMISED CONQUEROR:
VENGEANCE AND SALVATION (59:14 — 63:6)
a. Preface: situation and remedy (59:14-20)
The recapitulatory So looks back over all the ground covered
since 56:1 and introduces a summary statement (14—15Sab). This
is followed by the Lord’s reaction (15c, 16ab) and proposed
action (16c—18), and the preface ends with a new world centred
on Zion (19-20). , 14-15ab. Justice ... and righteousness are respectively moral
action arising out of moral principle (e.g. as in 1:21; 56:1).
Society, however, repels the one (driven back) and marginalizes
the other (distance). This applies, first (14cd), to public life (in
the streets), where truth — integrity, reliability, probity — has
collapsed (stumbled, ‘tripped over’) and honesty (‘uprightness’)
finds no entrance. Secondly, the same is true (15ab) of individual
life (whoever). Truth (as in 14c) is nowhere to be found — the verb
ddar means ‘to be missing’: personal probity is the missing ingredient — and forces at work in society set out to ruin (prey)
anyone who shuns evil. Things have gone beyond merely acting
against the person who seeks to stand up for what is right (Am.
5:10). Even to avoid wrong on a personal level makes one a
marked man. This is a very adequate summary indeed of society
as seen in 56:1 — 59:9. So what is to be done?
15c-16ab. Typically of the Bible, the Lord is depicted as
moving step by step to a decision as if he had been taken by
surprise at what has happened (cf. 52:5)! He was immediately
struck by two things: the state of people (no justice; cf. 9, 14) and
their helplessness (no-one). This latter observation matches 59:9—
13 in the same way as the former matches 59:3-8. Those to
whom the Lord granted the gift of repentance (57:19) and who
came under the disciplined correction of his word (58:1—14) are
helpless to eradicate their own sin (12-13), much less to purge
the world around. Displeased, he ‘took it badly’; appalled is
‘devastated, shattered’. Intervene, to ‘interpose’ (cf. 53:12f) so as
to save people from the consequences of personal and social breakdown.
16c-18. First (16cd), the Lord possesses within himself all that is needed to solve the problem: his arm (51:9; 52:10; 53:1) is the Lord himself acting in all his personal power. Worked salvation: since the work of salvation still lies ahead, the past tense here expresses what the Lord has determined upon — personal action in righteousness: his determination to fulfil all his
368
ISAIAH 59:19-20
righteous purposes and to do so in full accord with the righteous
demands and standards of his holy character. What the Lord is
(righteousness) and what he can do (arm) are the solution to the
world’s needs. Secondly (17), he dresses for the task. Clothing
represents what he is and what he commits himself to doing (Jos.
5:13). The military metaphor is significant. What remains to be
done to fulfil the vision of the King (chs. 1 — 37) is that his
enemies be overthrown worldwide; likewise, what remains from
the work of the Servant is the victory mentioned, for example
in 42:13. Righteousness (17) is the moral integrity of all the
Lord will do, salvation is the deliverance of his people,
vengeance is the just requital of his foes, and zeal the
determination which will bring the work to completion.
Worldwide (18) this work will be done with exact justice (what
they have done ... their due).
19-20. First, the Lord’s achievement will be worldwide: he
will be made known in his eternal nature (name, Ex. 3:15) and
receive the reverence that is his due (glory, 6:3). No-one will
know the truth (the revealed name) without responding in
reverence; and no-one will worship a glory they do not know.
This will, secondly, be a work of power (19). NIV (adopting a
minutely altered Hebrew text) presents this pictorially as a pentup flood, released and driven by a divine wind. The change is not,
however, necessary and is uncertain in detail. The words more
naturally mean, ‘When an adversary comes in like a stream, the
Spirit of the Lord lifts a banner against him.”' This could well be
a proverbial saying used appropriately here: the ‘adversary’ is all
that opposes the Lord and his helpless people, but the Lord’s
Spirit rallies his own forces (in context, the Lord’s ‘arm’ and
‘righteousness’, 16cd) to his banner (11:10) and wins the victory.
Thirdly (20), this new world is Zion-centred. From his victory
over their foes worldwide, the great Next-of-Kin who has taken
upon himself all their needs comes as victor to Zion (40:9-11;
52:7-10). But in Zion too there is a sifting. Not all who claim to
be of Zion will be saved in Zion: only the penitents (1:27-28;
57:18-19; Heb. 12:22-23; Rev. 21:27). The Lord is as holy in
redemption as in vengeance.
1 NIV reflects the understanding most favoured by commentators. The picture
is suitable, and involves only one tiny change to MT along with a slightly
questionable translation, “drives along’. This form of Vniis occurs nowhere else;
‘to cause to hurry’ is possible, if not wholly certain. But the form nds*sd could
derive from Vndsas (Zc. 9:16), ‘to use or wave a banner’.
369
ISAIAH 59:21
b. The Covenant Mediator and his achievement
(59:21 — 60:22)
i. The Covenant Mediator (59:21). The sequence of 59:1-20
is suddenly — and mysteriously — interrupted. The three sections
of accusation (1—4), description (5-8) and confession (9-13) have
been followed by a section on rectification (14-20), in which the
Lord himself undertakes to do what his people cannot do —
achieve vengeance and salvation on a worldwide scale, with Zion
at the centre of it all — and the sequence might well have ended
with glorification (60:1-22): Zion, the centre of world pilgrimage. What then do we make of 59:21?
First, the idea of a covenant with them fits into what has
preceded. ‘They’ are the worldwide people of verse 19 and the
penitents of 20 (cf. 1:27; 57:19), the world Israel of 19:24—25;
27:12-13; 45:14-25; 54:1 — 55:13. To each of these components
the Lord has already pledged a covenant relationship (54:10;
55:3; cf. 42:6; 49:8). Thus verse 21 actually brings 14-20 to a
suitable conclusion. Secondly, the worldwide, Zion-centred vengeance and salvation were attributed to the Spirit of the Lord
(19d, NIV breath). Verse 21 extends this truth: the Spirit who
effected the work of rectification now indwells the world Israel.
Thirdly, we have already met an Individual endowed with the
Spirit for a ministry of the word, the Lord’s Agent to the world
and to the people (42:14; 49:1-6; cf 50:4), the Servant of the
Lord, who brings worldwide (40:3-5; 52:10), Zion-centred
(40:9-11; 52:7-9) revelation and salvation. When the Lord
undertakes to rectify all that is amiss (59:14—20), it is not so
surprising, then, as it seems at first sight, that a Covenant Mediator comes into the picture at verse 21. Fourthly, like the Servant
of the Lord (53:10), this Spirit-endowed One has a family extending through the generations. His covenant status reaches back
to 54:10 (cf 53:5), the peace secured by the death of the Servant,
and to 55:3, the covenanted blessings accruing through the
eternal and universal kingship of David. Along with this he is the
repository and mediator of the Lord’s Spirit, bringing the gift of
the Lord’s word. As ever, the distinguishing mark of the separated people is their possession and expression of revealed truth. Finally, this introduction of the Covenant Mediator in 59:21, with its ‘tailpiece’ (60:1-22) affirming the worldwide signif- icance of the city of Zion, is the first of four passages in which he figures as the appointed Executor (53:10) of the Lord’s purposes. The second passage is 61:14, where the Anointed One brings in the day of favour and vengeance. Its tailpiece (61:5-9) pledges
370
ISAIAH 60: 1-3
restoration and a priestly people central to the nations. In the
third passage, 61:10 — 62:7, he receives the ‘garments of salvation’ which, in 59:17, the Lord himself donned in order to
undertake for his helpless people, and to achieve (cf. 59:18-20)
the glory of Zion at the centre of the world, a truth confirmed in
the tailpiece (62:8-12). And the fourth, 63:1-6, describes how
this splendidly robed figure returns, having accomplished vengeance and redemption. Formally, these four passages recall the
Servant Songs: the same number, with added tailpieces; and, in
each series, the first and fourth are reports, the second and third
are testimonies. In each series, too, the first passage (42:14;
59:21) concerns status and task, the second (49:1-6; 61:1-3)
ministry and objective, the third (50:4-9; 61:10 — 62:7) personal
commitment, and the fourth (52:13 — 53:12; 63:1-6) completion
of the work. In brief, here is a third messianic figure, completing
the portrayals of King (chs. 1 — 37) and Servant (38 — 55). The
King reigns, the Servant saves, and the Anointed One consummates salvation and vengeance.
ii. The universal city (60:1—22). This poem meditates on the
Abrahamic theme (Gn. 12:1-3) that those who bless him will be
blessed and those who curse him will be cursed. In the same way,
the coming glorious Zion (cf 2:2-4; 4:2-6; 25:6-10a; 26:1-6;
35:1-10) settles the destiny of the world (12). No geographical
Zion could contain the gathering world with its flocks; Isaiah is
foreseeing, in terms natural to him, both the present Zion of
Hebrews 12:22 and the coming Zion of Revelation 21:9-25.
The Lord in Zion (60:1-3). The city is not named immediately, but the feminine imperatives from verse 1 onwards look
back to Zion in 59:20 and forward to Zion in 14.
1. The Jight of the glory of the Lorb is both an objective
reality (rises, lit. ‘flashes’), a new dawn, and a subjective
experience (your light; cf. 9:2). It is given as a benefit to be
enjoyed (‘rise up’, 52:2) and a transforming experience (shine).
2-3. Moreover, the Lord’s glory in Zion is related to a world
darkness, present everywhere (earth), binding all (peoples). Light
dawning in Zion is the first banishment of this darkness, and is
designed to magnetize the world into blessing (3). Nations ...
kings: the contrasting pair (ruled and rulers) is an idiom of
totality; cf 49:7; 52:15, and the universal call of 55:1. The Lord
starts with his people in order that he may encompass the world
Ps. 67:1-2).
The ai in Zion (60:4-9). The magnetism — the typical Old
Testament emphasis in winning the nations (2:2-4; Dt. 4:5-8) -
371
ISAIAH 60:4-9
works. Zion is glorified in the gathering company (4-5), and this
universal people will be accepted as the Lord’s worshippers (6-7)
and will find their aspirations met in him (8-9). To confine or
even to link this vision to the return from Babylon is to fail to
listen to what Isaiah is saying. He envisages a whole world on the
move, involving even sea travel (9).
4. The reference to sons (also 9; cf 49:18) and daughters
views the world (49:22-23) in its traditional biblical ‘compartments’: those who ancestrally belong to Zion but need to be
brought back to the Lord (49:5—6), and those who are drawn from
the ‘outside’ world (Jn. 11:52), the whole Abrahamic family of
faith (Rom. 4:11-12). But ail (lit. ‘all of them’) in the first
instance refers to the nations and kings of verse 3. In other words,
the whole gathered ‘Israel’ of 45:14-25 is on pilgrimage home- wards, with no barrier of distance (afar) or of infirmity (carried) — allowed to hinder.
5~7. Two factors unite to bring radiant joy to Zion: first, this
great throng is coming with homage gifts to you (5c, which
begins with ‘For’, and 7a), and with devotion to serve you (7b);
secondly, they come, on their part, to (lit.) ‘tell the good news of
the Lord’s praises’ (6e), and, on the Lord’s part, as full participants in his worship (offerings ... my altar ... temple). Temple
should be ‘house’. The thought is not primarily of a place of
worship but of a ‘house’ where the Lord lives among his people.
The gathering company is literally coming home to God. Midian
(6; cf. Jdg. 6:1, which Isaiah may have had in mind; the former
despoiler is the coming worshipper) was in the south; Ephah was
to the east of the Persian gulf; Kedar (7) and Nebaioth to the
northeast, in the northern Arabian desert. The names are impressionistic of a world converging on Zion.
8-9. Clouds ... nests: the former is a picture of speed; the
latter of homecoming and safety (Ps. 84:3). Islands, see 11:11;
24:15; 41:1; 59:18; look to me, literally ‘wait’ (42:4). Consciously or unconsciously, the world’s longings can find fulfilment only
in the Holy One of Israel. They come contributing not insights
but silver and gold, gifts of submission, homage and devotion to the honour, literally ‘to the name’. There is no suggestion that their religion is even part of the truth; they come to where the truth is to be found (2:3), to the Lord whose name encapsulates what he has revealed of himself — found only in Zion, in which they discern a divinely given ‘beauty’. Jarshish (2:16; 23:1) may be in Spain, in which case Isaiah adds west to the compass bearings in verse 7; but in any event ships adds sea travel to land travel to complete the picture of the gathering multitudes.
372
ISAIAH 60:10-13
The city of destiny (60:10—-14). Here is the heart of this great
Zion poem. Verses 10 and 14 share the theme of international
enterprise to build Zion; 11 and 13 bring us inside the restored
city: its ever-open gates speak of unworried security (11; Zc. 2:4—
5); the Lord’s sanctuary speaks of his holy presence (13). The
central verse 12 makes Zion determinative of destiny: to hold
aloof from Zion is to come to destruction. 10. Foreigners: literally ‘sons of a stranger’; cf ‘sons of your
oppressors’ as an inclusio in 14. Rebuild ... serve are not pointers
to menial status but evidence of committed service. They are full
members of the community (7) and play their part. Though in
anger ... compassion: according to verse 3 they came magnetized
by the light in Zion, and in 9 they came because of the name of
the Lord; 3 is pictorial, 9 is general and 10 is specific. This is the
light which drew them, the name they needed to know, the God
in whom anger has turned to compassion (12:12), literally ‘in
my anger I struck you and in my favour/acceptance I have had
compassion on you’. The anger was real: gesep, explosive anger
(34:2; 54:8), but it has been replaced by ‘surging love’,
compassion (54:7).
11. Though the open gates cannot but speak of security, the
reason given here is that there is an unbroken stream of entrants.
Led in triumphant procession is probably the right interpretation.
Literally ‘and their kings led along’ could be a picture of captives
(45:14), which would of course symbolize willing subservience;
but the abbreviated expression rather means ‘with their kings
escorted’, coming in their own right as kings with their entourage, yet as Zion’s willing subjects.
12. Nation (géy) ... it (lit. ‘nations’; gdyim): the word
typically means the world outside the people of God. But it is not
their alien status which condemns them but their refusal of Zion’s
supremacy: the Lord’s light (3) is there but they will not be
drawn, his ‘name’ (9) is there but they will not come to learn, his
compassion (10) is there but they are careless of the threat of his
wrath. Their self-chosen fate is to perish in ruination.
13. Isaiah is drawing on the record of Solomon’s temple,
where Gentile Sidonians were enrolled because they were the
best (1 Ki. 5:2-9). My sanctuary: not, as now, a place in which
the endangered seek safety but ‘a place of holiness’ — holy for,
and because of, its holy Inhabitant (1 Ki. 8:12-19). Feet: i.e. the
Lord’s footstool, the point at which the transcendent God touches
earth. Here, the Holy of Holies is the place (in La. 2:1 it is Zion;
in 1 Ch. 28:2; Ps. 99:1—5; 132:7 it is the ark; and in Is. 66:1, earth
itself).
6 YE)
ISAIAH 60:14-18
14. In verse 10 the thought was of glad service; here the
emphasis is on reversal of roles: your oppressors, ‘those who
humiliated you’, now themselves come bowing before you. They
made you take the lowest place, now they willingly take it
themselves in order to enter the privileges and joys of Zion. Only
a triumph of grace could achieve this, for it is not Zion that
produces this ready submissiveness but the recognition that the
LorD is in his City in all his reality as the Holy One of Israel.
Zion transformed (60:15—22). In verses 15—16 three items of
rejection (forsaken, hated, no-one) are matched by three items of transformation (pride, milk, Saviour) — a transformation of repute
and fortune only to be explained as the Lord’s doing (16cd). In
17-18, Zion is transformed materially (17a—d), socially (17ef)
and spiritually (18). Never-failing spiritual illumination will
replace creational radiance (19, 20a—c) and with it all sorrow will
vanish (20d). Zion’s people will be right with God (21a),
eternally secure (21b), made what they are by the Lord in order to
‘embody’ the Lord’s beauty (21c-e) and personally transformed
in power (22ab). This vision is not too good to be true but, as
guaranteed by the Lord (22cd), too good not to be true.
15-16. No-one travelling through: i.e. shunned. Everlasting ...
all generations: the former is continuance in time, the latter
continuance in human experience. Drink ... be nursed: a picture
of enjoyment of the very best of loving care, maternal selfgiving. Nations, the erstwhile excluded, now brought in, cannot
do enough for the Zion in which they have found the Lord’s love
(10). Royal breasts: even earth’s greatest are ready to take a
ministering place in the city of salvation (18c). Saviour points to
the consummation of the promised salvation of 56:1. It has all
come about because the Lord, as Redeemer, has been willing to
act as Next-of-Kin and shoulder all the needs of his people.
17. The best of Jerusalem’s past (1 Ki. 10:21, 27) is laid under
contribution to convey the coming glory where everything is
transformed upwards. Peace: social transformation matches
material well-being. Here is the peace of a mature, harmonious
society where well-being and government are synonymous — in
the Hebrew here peace and governor (rather ‘government’) are in
apposition, meaning that each is the exact definition of the other; to say ‘peace’ / well-being’ is to say ‘government’, and vice versa. Righteousness is that which matches the Lord’s own righteous character and wishes. Ruler is ‘taskmaster’ (Ex. 3:7). Even the very worst that the past exemplified in oppressive rule will become the very best the Lord would wish. 18. Violence is specifically anti-personal behaviour; ruin and
374
ISAIAH 60:19-22
destruction are here every force for the breakdown of good social
order. Salvation ... Praise: see 26:1-3. The words balance each
other: salvation is what the Lord effects; praise is how we
respond. The Lord’s saving work keeps Zion secure and our
harmonious, appreciative relationship with him provides gates to
exclude every harmful thing. 19-20. In the old order of creation, life was governed rigidly
by night and day and unpredictably by the fitfulness of sun and
moon. But in the new order of salvation, the ruling principle is
the changeless presence of the Lord. Light ... glory (lit. “beauty’):
the Lord will illuminate and beautify his people; bathe them in
his light and change them into his likeness. The former is
explained by the promise of his unchanging illumination (20c,
beginning with ‘for’) and the latter illustrated by the banishment
“s ed of days of sorrow (20d), whatever would cast the least
ight.
In verses 21-22, having reviewed repute (15-16), society (17—
18) and circumstances (19-20), Isaiah finally turns to people:
their standing before God (21a), security of tenure (21b), how
they have come into being (21c-e), their prospects (22ab) and the
confidence with which they can face the future (22cd).
21. Righteous: right with God, leading to righteousness of
character and conduct. Possess: Isaiah uses what he knows to
predict what he foresees. Did he know that these territorial
predictions would (not be contradicted or modified by but) find
their realization in a ‘kingdom not of this world’ (Jn. 18:36)?
Probably he did, for he was the one who foresaw that the levitical
sacrifices would (not be contradicted or modified by but) realized
in the substitutionary death of the Servant (52:13 — 53:12). In any
case he is using the terms and conditions of the gift of the
promised land (Dt. 6:18-25; 28:63-64; 2 Sa. 7:10). When righteousness is perfected, tenure is secure (Rom. 5:1-2, 21). Shoot ...
planted ... hands: behind their enjoyment of righteousness and
security lies the careful work of the divine Gardener. Isaiah (11:1;
14:19) uses shoot of the messianic King and of a rejected king
(only elsewhere used in Dn. 11:7). In the heavenly Zion (Heb.
12:22) all the inhabitants will be like their king, who has put
them where they are (planted), made them what they are (work)
and done all for his own purpose, the display of my splendour (lit.
‘beauty’). The likeness of the king is the likeness of the Lord.
22. Least ... thousand ... smallest ... mighty: 51:2 recalls
another Jeast who became a thousand and a nation. Isaiah is
envisaging the ultimate fulfilment of the Abrahamic promise
(which John was yet to outline in Rev. 7:9-17). Do this swiftly:
cP)
ISAIAH 61:1
ie. without delay or hindrance within his own pre-determined
timetable (2 Pet. 3:18-19). But the verb may mean ‘to enjoy’ (Ec.
2:25), and so express the delightful truth that the joy which the
Lord lost when sin entered the world (Gn. 1:10, 12418; 21, 25;
31) he, too, will recover in the new Zion and its people. Since
Isaiah would have been fully aware of these two meanings, we do
not have to choose between them but gratefully hold both in the
richness of scriptural truth.
c. The Anointed One and his transforming work (61:1—9)
i. First testimony of the Anointed One: transformation
(61:14). The Servant Songs meshed into their context, and the
same is true of the coming three passages on Isaiah’s third
messianic figure, the Anointed One. (See pp. 370-371.) Here, as
in 59:21, he is anointed with the Lord’s Spirit for the ministry of
the word. In addition to this, (a) as in the second Servant Song
(49:1-6), his job description is elaborated and extended. The
donation of the divine Spirit to Zion’s citizens (59:21) is now a
ministry of comfort (1-2) and transformation (3), and moves also “jn another direction altogether in the executing of vengeance —
the recipients of which are left undefined. (b) Just as the Servant
does what the Lord undertook to do (e.g. 52:10; 53:1), so the
tasks of favour and vengeance were previously the Lord’s
(59:17). (c) The transformation of Zion’s experiences (2c, 3) was
forecast in 60:17ff., and the work of planting (3) links with
60:21. Isaiah is thus taking his messianic portraiture into its next stage: the endowed Zionf 59:21 becomes the transformed Zion of 60:17—22 through the anointed ministry of 61:1-3. This is the passage which Jesus chose to read in Nazareth (Lk. 4:16—22),
establishing the messianic credentials of Isaiah’s presentation. It
is to be noted that Jesus ended his reading at the day of the
LORD’ favour (2a). What Isaiah saw as one messianic work, the
Lord Jesus divided into two: the salvific purpose of his first
coming (Jn. 3:17), and the judgmental component of his second coming (Jn. 5:22-29; cf 2 Thes. 1:7-10). The testimony is in
three unequal parts: his preparation (lab), his task (the seven
infinitives of 1c—3g), and the results to follow (3h—4). 1. The Spirit ... preach: a link is immediately made with 59:21, but we are now allowed to learn for what purpose the Anointed One shares the Spirit and the word with his children: it is, ii fact, the "word in season fo the Weary’ OF SU:2- transforming in its effect. Sovereign LORD: this title links with the second Servant Song (50:5, 7, 9). LORD is ‘Yahweh’, the exodus God (Ex. 3:15) who saves his people and overthrows his and their
376
ISAIAH 61:2-3
foes, in fact the God of favour and vengeance (2ab). In this work
he is Sovereign, i.e. able and irresistible. Jo preach good news:
see 40:9; 42:1; 49:2; 50:4. Poor: the downtrodden and dis- advantaged, helpless in themselves and at the mercy of powerful
people and adverse circumstances. Bind_up: to ‘bandage’,
speaking of a personal ministry of soothing id healing. Brokenhearted: a word covering any and every human breakdown,
emotional prostration, conviction of sin (57:15). Freedom:
specifically manumission of slaves (Lv. 25:10; Je. 34:80), linking
the ministry of the Anointed One and the Year of Jubilee (cf
27:13), cf year, 2a. Captives ... prisoners: the former are those
held captive by people, the latter those imprisoned in jail; the
contrast expresses ‘release of every sort’. Release: the verb
lpagah means ‘to open the eyes’. The reduplicated form here
(p’qah-qéah) would mean ‘wide-opening (of the eyes)’, the
ae of prisoners out of the dark dungeon into the light
2. The repetition of to proclaim indicates that Isaiah is dealing
with the same subject but from an altered point of view. In verse
1 the proclamation touched on the human side — freedom, release
— but now it concerns the divine side. Favour ... vengeance: in
49:8 the Lord’s favour guaranteed the Servant’s success; in 60:7
the Lord (lit.) ‘accepts with favour’ the offering of the Gentiles;
and in 60:10 his favour expresses itself in ‘compassion’. The
coming of the Anointed One marks the year, the prolonged period, in which the Servant’s achievement can be enjoyed: Gentiles
are fully accepted and compassion flows freely. But his coming
also makes inevitable the day of vengeance. Day contrasts with
year, a sharp, quickly accomplished work. Vengeance (naqam):
just requital, the apportionment of what is justly due (35:4; 47:3;
59:17; 63:4; cf, the verb in 1:24). To comfort is the other aspect of
requital: exact recompense for wrong suffered (57:1 8).
3. Provide ... bestow: in verse 2c the hurt was soothed, but
now every possibility of further hurt is removed by a divine
r . The first verb points to a decision of God
and the second to an act of God: he wills our comfort and then
gives that which brings and perpetuates comfort. Note the
downward movement of the transformation: from the crown (lit.
‘head-dress’; 3:20; cf’ 61:10; Ex. 39:28), to the head (oil), to the
clothing (garment). (Cf. the running down of Ps. 133:2-3, significant of heavenly outpouring.) Note also the inward movement
of ashes, the visible evidence of grief (58:5; 2 Sa. 13:19), to
mourning, grief in the heart, to the inner spirit of despair. The
Lord thus acts to pierce progressively to the innermost need. Oil
377
ISAIAH 61:4—-6b
of gladness: in Psalm 45:7 the ‘oil of joy’ explains the distinctive
character of the king. Thus the Anointed One replaces mourning
with new life. Garment: more properly ‘a wrap’, over-all cover.
Just as (see 59:17) donning garments symbolizes character and
commitment, so the gift of an all-covering garment symbolizes
the gift of a new nature leading to a new life. Despair (keha):
used in 42:3 of the dimly burning wick, what is dull, listless,
expiring. They will be called: the infinitives that express the aims
of the Anointed One give way to a statement of achievement, literally ‘It will be called to them’, stressing the objective reality
of the gift of a new name, i.e. a new nature with new potencies
(Gn. 17:5-6). Oaks: used in 1:29 and 57:5 in connection with
false religion, but here they have been recovered for the Lord and
given an established place in his garden. Righteousness: their
status and acceptance before God are entirely of his doing (as in 53:11; 54:17): they are a planting of the LORD. Splendour: see
60:21e. 4. Matching ‘they will be called’ (3), we read they will rebuild.
Given a new status, a new name with new powers, they are able
to enter upon new activity. The picture, of course, is of the return
from Babylon to face the task of reconstruction; the reality is the
new life into which the Anointed One will bring his people
(healed, 1de; comforted, 2c; clothed, 3a—g; rooted, 3h-j),
bringing with it powers of reconstruction to mend every past
breakdown, no matter how long-standing (ancient, generations).
ii. Transformation confirmed (61:5—9). This is the tailpiece
to the Song of the Anointed and, like the tailpiece to the second
Servant Song, it falls into two parts: the subservience of the
nations (5—6; 49:7) and the Lord’s covenant with his people (7-9;
49:8). The picture of life and prosperity confirms verses 3-4,
while at the same time building on the internationalism of 60:10,
14. This is a world community (5-6), transformed (7ab), settled
(7c-e), joyous (7f), brought into covenant (8), under divine
blessing (9).
_ 5-6b, Recognition by the nations, nearness to the Lord. The picture is not of slaves or second-class citizens but of the glad commitment of those coming in from the ‘outside’ to serve the people of God, to take their place within a serving community (cf 60:10). Shepherd: (lit.) ‘stand and shepherd’, used of the Messiah (Mi. 5:4); ‘stand’ indicates steady continuance. Priests: the hitherto unrealized ideal of Exodus 19:6, fully realized in the priesthood of all believers. Cf 66:21, where incoming Gentiles are included in this priestly nearness to the Lord.
378
ISAIAH 61:6c-9
6c—7d, Reversal, recompense and transformation. Wealth ...
riches, see 60:16 (Rom. 15:27); riches is ‘glory’ (Rev. 21:26).
Shame goes beyond feeling embarrassment, it is reaping shame,
disappointment of hope, exposure as fraudulent. Double: amply,
more than fully. Rejoice: ‘sing’ (54:1), ie. enter with joy into
what has been freely provided. Inheritance: literally ‘portion’,
what the Lord has allocated to them.'
7ef, Possession and joy. These two lines are the heart pivot of
the poem. Double may, as in verse 7b, mean ‘abundantly, more
than enough’, or it may here be the double portion given to the
firstborn (e.g. Gn. 48:22; Dt. 21:17; 2 Ki. 2:9; of. Ex. 4:22).
8, Divine justice, recompense and covenant. The initial For
explains the blessings listed in verses 6-7, which are due to the
Lord’s justice (8a), his hatred (8b) and his faithfulness (8c). First,
in bringing this world Israel into being, with all its transformed
status and joys, he acts with the justice he loves. In ‘favour’ as
well as in ‘vengeance’ (2), the Lord is impeccably just. His
‘favour’ is not favouritism; it is the justice required by the just
nature of his saving work. Secondly, he abides by his own
standards: robbery and iniquity is an emendation’ from ‘I hate
robbery in burnt offering’, an expression parallel to (lit.) ‘their
due in faithfulness’ (8c). The burnt offering ‘held nothing back’
(Gn. 22:16), and anything less was robbing the Lord of his due.
The Lord recalls this as he pledges that he will live up to his own
standards: in his faithfulness he will hold nothing back when he
‘gives his people their due’. Thus the ‘double’ (7) is the Lord’s
perfect justice (8a), his due and full requital (8c), and turns out to
be (8d) his everlasting covenant with them, rather ‘for them’, to
their advantage (cf 55:3). The reference is to 59:21, where the
Anointed One shares with his children the blessings of his
anointing, but the blessings secured to them by this covenant are
now also the fruits of the ministry of the Anointed One in verses
3+4.
9, Recognition by the nations, blessed by the Lord. Descendants (9a) and peoples (9d) are both ‘seed’, referring to 59:21
where children ... descendants are both ‘seed’. This worldwide
1 In 61:7de, the translation inheritance... inherit clouds the fact that the Heb.
uses different words. In 7d, héleg means ‘apportionment’; in 7e, Vyaras 1s ‘to
come into possession’. : pipe eh acres
2mt reads b%6/d, ‘in burnt offering’. The emendation is b*‘aw‘'la. Watts
accepts this and translates ‘robbery by injustice’, depriving a person of his goods
by unjust social action (/saiah, p. 87). This is a contrived meaning for ‘aw*la
which, of itself, has no juridical overtones and is not so used elsewhere. The word
simply means ‘deviation from norm’.
379
ISAIAH 61:10-11
recognition is the ideal intended (Dt. 4:5-8) but never hitherto
realized. But it is the Lord who will be ‘glorified in his holy
people and ... marvelled at’ (2 Thes. 1:10) — which is meant to be
the case now, as we live in the interim between verse 2a and 2b.
d. The Saviour and his gathered people (61:10 — 62:12)
i. Second testimony: acceptance of the role of Saviour
(61:10 — 62:7). The parallel with the four Servant Songs
continues. In the third Song (50:4-9) the Servant testified to his acceptance of the Lord’s will and committed himself to obedience and suffering. In the present verses someone accepts with
joy (Heb. 12:2) the task of salvation (61:10) and commits himself
to its completion (62:1). Who is this? The first-person singular
continues from 61:1, which in turn looks back to the Anointed
One of 59:21. This beautiful poem is in four sections, two
alternating pairs. Joy in the work of salvation (61:10) is matched
by joy in transformed Zion (62:4—5); note how each section has
the same pictures of marriage and the productive earth. The
single intercessor (62:1-3) is matched by the interceding
company (62:6—7): in the former, kings see the new Zion; in the
latter, Zion is the praise of the earth. 10-11. The motif of ‘clothing’ expresses_character_and commitment. To be clothed with garments of salvation is to be
commissioned and fitted to be Saviour; to accept the clothes
stands for self-commitment to the task. A decisive point has been
reached in the delineation of the Anointed One: his sharing of
himself with his family (59:21) and the blessings he brings
(61:1—4) are now seen as a saving work. At the outset (59:14—
17), the Lord’s distress over his helpless people was such that he
robed himself as Saviour. Now he confers this task on the
Anointed One, who accepts the task with delight and rejoicing
(10ab). Salvation ... righteousness: the former is that which
meets our need; the latter what meets the Lord’s holy standards.
Robe: a ‘wrap’ (see 3). Bridegroom ... bride: as their garments
proclaim to all that they are bridegroom and bride and announce
their commitment to marriage, so with the same care the Lord has
fitted his Anointed One for the saving work. This, then, is the first reason for his joy (For, 10c): he has been designated and equipped by the Lord. The second reason (For, 11a) is that the work is destined to succeed; it is as Certain as the processes of germination and growth. As with come up (‘sprout’) and seeds, the Sovereign LORD will himself see to it that this will come to universal (nations) fruition (spring). Righteousness ... praise: the
380
ISAIAH 62:1-—5
former is the saving work as it satisfies God (10c), the latter is the
response it excites in the recipients.
62:1-3. Matching the face set like a flint (50:7) in pursuance
of the Lord’s will, the Anointed One determines that the work of
salvation and righteousness will be consummated.
1. For Zion’s sake: the Anointed One’s delight in the Lord
(61:10) is matched by his longing for Zion’s well-being, ie. the
well-being of those whom he designs to save. Silent: the verb
hasG applies as much to action (e.g. Jdg. 18:9; Ps. 107:29) as to
words (e.g. Pss. 28:1; 39:2). The parallelism of the poem (see
opposite) balances this section with the posting of intercessors
(6), and this suggests that what is in mind is a minis f prayer
(Heb. 7:25). Quiet (Vsaqaf): to be inactive. The Anointed One
commits himself to ceaseless action, just as to ceaseless prayer.
Righteousness ... salvation: cf. 61:10cd. The Servant (lit.) “provided righteousness for the many’ (53:11). It is in this sense that
righteousness belongs to her, the righteousness with which she is
clothed as a result of the work of the Servant, and now of the
Anointed One. Salvation: if the Anointed One is clothed to
accomplish salvation (61:10), then salvation can only be ‘hers’ by
his gift. Dawn (lit. ‘brightness’) and blazing torch both refer in
the first instance to the dramatic way in which the work of
righteousness and salvation was done but, secondly, to the
‘dawning’ of righteousness and salvation in the lives of the saved.
2. What the Lord does for Zio is r the world to see and
4ab) acknowledge. Nations ... kings: see 49:7; 52:15; 60:3,
‘iat Before the world (2ab), Zion will display her new
righteous nature in all its glory; personally (2cd), Zion will be
aware of a new nature, signified by a new name (see Gnr 17:3);
bringing with it new potentialities and powers; in relation to the
Lord (3), Zion will be a crown. A crown is a sign of ro jal dignity.
The surprising picture here is that the Lord holds his people as
the sign to the watching world that he is king.
4-5. The Anointed One will achieve a transformation like the
change from lonely desolation (4ab) to happy marriage (4c—5) —
the result of the work of the Servant in 54:1-8. The emptied city
and the wasted land become the objects of delight (4ce), devotion
(4df) and joy (5). The new names Hephzibah (‘My delight is in
her’, NIV mg.) and Beulah (‘Married’, NIV mg.) are explained in
the two halves of verse 5: respectively the wedding and the
honeymoon. Zion’s sons make their marriage vow to their bride
to ‘love and to cherish’, to give themselves in devoted service to
the welfare of Zion, and the Lord goes on honeymoon with his
people, rejoicing over them. With such economy of words and
381
ISAIAH 62:6-9
beauty of imagery Isaiah depicts the loving unanimity that
characterizes Zion and her intimate union with the Lord — which
Revelation 19:7 foresees as the marriage of the Lamb.
6-7. The Anointed One committed himself to the task of
creating a people who would publicly display their saved and
righteous status so that Zion might become the praise of the
earth. The duly of those who have received the Lord’s righteousness and Salvation is to take their stand on Zion’s walls and pray unceasingly that this might come to be. The fulfilment of the
ord’s purposes for Zion co n’s
people. Our prayers, as we both live in Zion (Heb. 12:22) and
Fait for Zion (Rev. 21:10), are our part in the guardian care of
our city (watchmen). It is a ceaseless task (day ... night — lit. ‘all
the day ... all the night’), vocal (never silent) and vital (give
yourselves no rest ... give him no rest) — as if, without our
prayers, the Lord would be slack concerning his promise (“pray
as if on that alone hung the issue of the day’) — and also
unremitting: sill he establishes Jerusalem. The praise of the
earth: that for which the earth renders praise. Why the earth
should give praise for Zion this passage does not explain, but the
fact is that the Lord’s salvation of his people is not just for
display purposes (61:llcd; 62:2ab). In saving his people, the
Lord has also saved a worldwide people (cf. 55:1). 1%
ii. The Lord’s oath, summons and proclamation (62:8-12). — This tailpiece has significant links with the foregoing testimony
of the Anointed One.(61:10 — 62:7). First, there is a picture of
security of possession and assured enjoyment (8-9). Loss of
crops was a familiar pre-exilic experience, and the denial of its
recurrence would have spoken tellingly of secure tenure and
enjoyment. Secondly, both Zion and the nations figured in the
testimony, each looking forward to something yet to be experienced, something for which Zion prays and into which the
nations will enter with praise (6-7). Now both the people (10a)
and ‘the peoples’ (NIV nations, 10e) are summoned to take to the road as pilgrims. Thirdly, the promise was made that the desolate and forsaken would be married and cherished (4), and this is now the subject of a divine proclamation: salvation is coming (11) and the perfect Zion is in sight (12). In short, verses 8-12 confirm all that was promised or implied in 61:10 — 62:7. 8-9. Hand ... arm: the hand is personal intervention and the arm is personal power — the Lord’s commitment of all that he is to the task. Grain ... enemies: a picture not just of safety but of obedience (cf Lv. 26:16; Dt. 28:30-33; Jdg. 6:1-6). The courts of
382
ISAIAH 62:10-12
my sanctuary: or, ‘in the courts of my holiness’. The secure
plenty that the people enjoy is accompanied by an unclouded
intimacy with the Holy God. 10-11. Isaiah likes double imperatives in moments of high
drama (51:9; 52:1, 11; 57:14), and the pilgrimage to Zion is
something that captured his imagination (24:16; 25:1-9; 27:12-
13; 35:1—-10). Thus the invitation is issued, the roads resurfaced
(prepare), the way unmistakable (highway), hindrances gone
(stones) and a worldwide people summoned (banner for the
nations, lit. ‘peoples’; cf. 11:10, 12; 49:22). In verse 11 there are
three ‘beholds’. The first (1lab, omitted in NIV) calls attention to
the fact that the invitation goes out with the Lord’s own authority.
The second (llcd) alerts Zion to her coming ‘salvation’ (not
Saviour): this does not retreat from the universal proclamation of
llab, for Zion’s salvation (54:1) is the world’s salvation (55:1). It
is what the Lord himself undertook (59:16) and then committed
to his Anointed One (61:1f), clothing him with the garments of
salvation (61:10) for the task. It was pledged as coming (56:1)
and now is imminent. New Testament theology thinks here of the
ever-imminent return of Jesus (Phil. 3:20-21; Heb. 9:28). The
third ‘behold’ (1lef) calls attention to the completed task of the
One who comes: his reward and recompense are defined in the
next verse as ‘they ... the Holy People’. For what he has done he
has received ‘pay’ (reward), the people whom he has gathered to
himself from the whole world. They are also what he has
accomplished (recompense, ‘fruit of work’). In 40: 10 this coming
Shepherd-Warrior is the Lord himself. In the flow of the present
context it is the Anointed One.
12. This gathering universal company (they) are holy (cf. 4:3).
This is no longer an ideal prefaced by the ‘if’ of Exodus 19: 5-6,
for they will be called speaks as if from the point of view of an
observer: holiness is what such a one would see. They are the
finally perfected people, living in the full reality of a finished
salvation (Heb. 10:12-14). Redeemed: those to whom the Lord
made himself Next-of-Kin, taking all their needs as his own
(35:9-10). Sought After: the verb ‘to seek’ is often used of people
assiduously coming to the Lord (56:6; 65:10), but here it is the
Lord himself seeking, finding and gathering his worldwide
people (Ezk. 34:11; Jn. 1:43; 9:35; 11:52). Deserted: as in 54:6.
Every former woe is a thing of the past.
e. The consummation: the Anointed One completes his task
(63:1-6)
In 62:11 we were called to watch for a coming ‘salvation’, which
383
ISAIAH 63: 1-3
62:12 personalized into the coming of One who had completed
the saving work. Now we are invited right into that situation, and
given a privileged position alongside watchmen on Zion’s walls
as a mysterious figure approaches majestically and proclaims the
execution of vengeance, redemption and salvation. The message
of the Lord’s garments (59:16), given to his Anointed (61:10), is
now proclaimed as completed, exactly as in the vengeance and
salvation greeted with the resounding hallelujahs of Revelation
19:1-8. 1. Cf, 52:8: watching for the king (52:7), for the Lord making
bare his arm (52:10), they actually saw ‘my Servant’ (52:13) ...
‘the arm of the Lord’ (53:1). Now, afar off, they see an
unrecognized figure (Who ...?), noticing only that he comes from
Edom ... Bozrah (see on 34:1ff.). Edom is the ceaseless foe (Am.
1:11), typical of David’s victories (2 Sa. 8:13—14), the final,
eschatological enemy (34:5; Ezk. 35). Just as the Servant is
David (55:3), so the Anointed One comes now like David as the
Victor over Edom. But Edom means ‘red’, matching the reddened
garments (2), and Bozrah, its capital city, means ‘vintage’,
matching the winepress motif (2). The chosen foe and the just
requital match each other. But, as yet, the watchmen can see only
generalities: first, his garments — not stained crimson (the word
hamis means ‘sharpened’, indicating the ‘sharp’ colours they see
in the distance), but his ‘vivid garments’; secondly, his splendour
— no bedraggled figure this, but ‘majestic’; thirdly, his gait —
striding forward, the purposeful and energetic walk of One who
is confident; and, fourthly, his strength. There is no weakness, nor
even — notwithstanding that he comes, as we will learn, from
battle — tiredness. Greatness is more exactly ‘abundance’. He is
brimming with vigour.
Who is he? First, he is a speaker (speaking). The Anointed
One was first introduced as endowed with the word (59:21); he
exercised a ministry of the word in vengeance and’ salvation
(61:1—2); when he donned his garments (61:10) he vowed not to keep silent (62:1; Rev. 19:13, 21). Now he speaks again, and does so as one whose righteousness is intact and whose self-awareness is that he is mighty to save —- One whose saving work is effective and matches every standard of righteousness. Mighty (cf, greatness) is ‘abundant’. Merely ‘great’ strength could rise to an occasion and then, perhaps, be spent; ‘abundant’ strength cannot be exhausted, and as abundant as his strength so is his salvation, inexhaustible in its efficacy. 2-3. Why ...? The Marcher is now close enough for the watchers to observe that the ‘sharp’ colour is not a colour at all
384
ISAIAH 63:4-6
but a stain, as in treading grapes. The Anointed One takes up
their simile (2). There has indeed been a winepress — but of
wrath; and a vintage to tread — but of people; with a consequent
redness — but of blood! No-one: as in 59:16 (cf 50:2); solitariness
is stressed. From the nations (‘peoples’): as we would say ‘noone in the whole wide world’; but also ‘peoples’ looks back to
62:10e. The recipients of the benefit (62:11-12) had no part in
reaching their blessedness. The whole work of judgment (3), like
the whole work of salvation (5), is exclusively, uniquely,
individually his. The vigour of his action (trampled ... trod) is
matched by the rage that motivated it: anger (’ap) is the snort of
an anger personally felt; wrath (hémd) is the heat and intensity of
anger. Blood (nésah), only here and in verse 6, is ‘spurting
blood’; stained (Vga’al) equally means ‘pollute’. As to the fact,
his clothing was stained; as to effect, it was polluted: his task
involved exposing himself to ‘defilement’, yet he returned with
his righteousness intact (1).
4. Now comes the explanation (For). A task undertaken alone
(3ab), the venting of anger rigorously applied (3cd), garments
soaked in blood, defilement risked (3ef) — what is the explanation? It was like the exodus acts of God. Vengeance must be
distanced from any thought of sinful vengefulness. It is due,
exact requital — like the visitations on Egypt in return for persistent refusal of the word of God. It is redemption, the loving act
of the Kinsman, who cannot bear that his next-of-kin should suffer any more or any longer but longs that they should be rescued.
5-6. The fact of sole action is again asserted. It is stated in
verse 3, and hinted at by the reference to heart in 4: verse 3 is the
fact of solitariness; 4, his willingness to act alone; and 5, his
sense of the tragedy of things as they are — i.e. that wrath should
remain uninflicted and salvation unaccomplished. On arm...
salvation, see 59:16. What the Lord undertook, the Anointed One
performed. Drunk: cf. the picture of the cup of wrath (51:17, 21—
22). Blood on the ground: i.e. lifeblood irretrievably shed and
therefore a work of wrath decisively finished.
XII. THE NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH:
PRAYERS AND PROMISES (63:7 — 66:24)
The theme of these chapters is the praying people (63:7 — 64:12)
and the promising God (65:1 — 66:24). The sombre passage 63:1—
6 described the requital of every foe and the redemption of all the
saved. What can possibly remain? Only prayer for its fulfilment,
resting on the sure promises of God.
385
ISAIAH 63:7-9
a. A ‘remembrancer’ at prayer (63:7 — 64:12)
In 62:6, the Anointed One, zealous for the realization of the
worldwide glory of Zion, posted watchmen-intercessors to pray
till all was fulfilled. They are described there as ‘you who call on
the LORD’, literally ‘you who keep the Lord in remembrance’.
The same word now occurs in the singular (63:7): ‘I will keep
(someone) in remembrance’ (J will tell, NIV). Here is the
watchman-intercessor at his task. Typically of Bible prayers, the
‘remembrancer’ begins by ‘telling God about God’ (63:7-14)
before turning to intercession (63:15 — 64:12). (Cf Ne. 9:6ff.; Dn.
9:4; Acts 4:24—30.)
i. Remembering (63:7-14). God’s people desire to ask
according to his will. Their primary concern is to know the God
to whom they speak. The ‘remembrancer’, then, reminds himself
of the Lord’s unfailing love and goodness (7), his caring
commitment to his people (8-9), and, above all, how his ongoing
patience with them has been secured by his foundational acts of
redemption (10-14).
7. In the Hebrew this verse begins and ends with kindnesses.
The word hesed is the Lord’s pledged love for his people; here
plural, to intensify and amplify, a love that never changes and
that contains to the full every ingredient of true love. About this
love he recalls three things, First, it has been displayed in action:
deeds ... done; the verb Vgamal means ‘to do completely’ and - underlines the rich sufficiency of the Lord’s love in action.
Secondly, it is bountiful and beneficent: many good things,
literally ‘abundant goodness’ (cf ‘abundant’ in 63:1). Thirdly, it
is a heart-love: compassion (49:15; 54:7; 55:7; 63:15), emotional,
passionate, personal (1 Ki. 3:26).
8-9. In love the Lord identifies with his people (8a), hopes the
best of them (8b), commits himself to them in saving action (8c),
feels their sorrows (9a), lives savingly among them (9b),
undertakes the position of Next-of-Kin (9c) and bears the burden
of them (9d) perseveringly (9e). The references to sons (see Ex.
4:22), became their Saviour (Ex. 14:30), shared distress (Ex. 3:7)
and my people (Ex. 3:10) indicate that already Isaiah is recalling the exodus as the great proof of the relationship of love. Love cannot be seen to be love until it does some benefit for the loved one. The Lord loved not in heart or word only but in deed and effectiveness: he became their Saviour ... saved them.' Angel of
| He too was distressed, \it. ‘adversity to him’, is another occasion where a choice has to be made between /6‘, ‘not’, and /6, ‘to him’ (here, in a possessive
386
ISAIAH 63:10-I1
his presence: literally ‘of his face’. We recognize people by face;
‘face’ is the Lord’s very own presence (Ps. 139:7), among them
in the person of his angel — that unique ‘Angel of the Lord’ (e.g.
Gn. 16:7ff.; 21:17; 22:11, 15; Ex. 3:2; 14:19; 23:20-23; Mal. 3:1)
who speaks as the Lord and is yet distinct from him, in whom the
holy God ‘accommodates’ himself to live among sinners, an Old
Testament anticipation of Jesus. Love: the noun ’ah*bd occurs
here for the only time in Isaiah (cf the verb V’ahéb, 43:4; 48:14;
61:8). It is the love which delights in the companionship of the
loved one. Mercy (hemld) is well illustrated by its only other
occurrence in Genesis 19:16 — the gentle pity that spares.
Redeemed: see 35:9; used also in Genesis 48:16 of a Next-ofKin’s identification with all the cares of life.
Verses 10-14 meditate on the exodus experience of Israel: the
hurt they inflicted by rebellion (10ab), provoking divine antagonism (10cd; cf Ps. 78); the changeless divine mind (11a, lit.
‘and he remembered’), expressed in fundamental acts of salvation
(11-12) and providential care (13-14); the intertwining of the
welfare of the people and the good name of the Lord (14).
10. They: emphatic, ‘they of all people!’ Rebelled: \mara
(1:20; 3:8; 50:5), provocative rebellion. His Holy Spirit: ‘the
Spirit of his holiness’, possessing, matching and expressing his
holy nature (30:1; 31:3; 48:16; 59:19; Ps. S51 tis ci Ne. 9320540;
Hg. 2:5). This passage is full of the person of the Spirit as a
distinct divine Being: Holy (10b, 11f), personal (grieved; cf: Eph.
4:30), and the agent in the Lord’s care of his people (14). Along
with (lit.) ‘the angel of his face’ (9b), and his ‘glorious arm’ (12;
51:9; 52:10; 53:1), these references to the Holy Spirit reveal the
tichness of the Old Testament’s understanding of the divine
nature. God is ‘one’ (Dt. 6:4) but not a bare unit. Rather, he is
‘one’ as the tabernacle was ‘one’ (Ex. 36:18), a rich unity of
many elements. The New Testament does not (so to speak)
multiply the one God of the Old Testament by three but refocuses
this rich diversification within the divine nature to reveal Father,
Son and Holy Spirit (Mk. 1:9-11; 2 Cor. 13:14; 1 Pet. 1:2). God
revealed in the Old Testament is the Holy Trinity incognito. They
rebelled ... he turned: those who refuse his way become his
enemies (1:24) — and he theirs.
11. His people recalled: see may he recall (NIV mg.), but
translate ‘And he remembered’. Note the sequence: ‘they rebelled
sense, ‘adversity was his’). Either is acceptable. The former would yield the
translation ‘In all their adversities no adversary he’, a negative statement of the
Lord’s identification with his suffering people.
387
ISAIAH 63:12-14
... he turned ... he remembered’. In the thick of their rebellion
and his holy revulsion, the Lord’s mind returned to basics. Moses
would ‘remind’ the Lord of his purpose to save (Ex. 3:7—-8); his
people would remind him of his saving achievement (Ex. 6:6—-7).
Where ...? introduces a divine soliloquy, as if the Lord were
meditating, ‘Why am I different now from what I was then?’ The
sea: the Red Sea deliverance was the consummation of the saving
work (Ex. 14: 13, 30-31). Shepherd: literally plural, either plural
of majesty, referring to Moses as the ‘supreme shepherd’, or numerical plural, referring to Moses and Aaron (Ps. 77:19-20);
but, in either case, recalling that saving deliverance was followed
by providential care (13-14). Set his Holy Spirit: see Haggai 2:5. The reference is to the indwelling of the Lord himself in the
tabernacle (Ex. 29:44—46).
12. Glorious arm of power: (lit.) ‘his beautiful arm’. In
contrast to 53:1, Moses was not the Arm of the Lord but knew
the companionship of that Arm. Divided ... waters: at the start of
the journey, the Red Sea (Ex. 14); at the end, Jordan (Jos. 4).
What the Lord did in the exodus was a completed work: he
brought them out in order to bring them in (Dt. 4:37—38) and the
question is implied, ‘Can I now give them up?’ To this the motive
to gain for himself everlasting renown (lit. ‘an everlasting name’)
provides the answer (cf. Ex. 32:12; Nu. 14:13-16; Jos. 7:9; Ezk.
20:9, 14, 22). The repute of the Lord is bound up with his
commitment to his people.
13-14. In those days no barrier was allowed to hinder his
people. Rather, to the Lord, even uncrossable water (depths) was
as straightforward as a horse in open country, and, under the
superintendence of the Lord’s Spirit, they were given rest,
brought home into the promised land. Behind all this review lies
one fundamental assumption: the Lord does not change; what he
was then he still is. It is to this thought that the remembrancer
finally comes (14cd). First, guided sums up the whole course
from slavery in Egypt, through redemption, shepherding care,
removal of barriers, into Canaan. Such love! Such forbearance!
Such power! Was it all for nothing? Secondly, your people recalls
that the exodus redemption set up a permanent relationship which (8, 11) has not changed. True, they have never lived up to their dignity, but are they not still loved with a never-changing love (7)? Thirdly, it was all designed to reveal the Lord’s ‘name of beauty’, a task he will never desert.
ii. Asking (63:15 — 64:12). Now that he has considered the nature of his God, the remembrancer can turn to prayer. He has
388
ISAIAH 63:15—17
discerned that the Lord is always on the side of his people: his
love never ends (7); he feels their plight even when he is grieved
by their sin (8-10); though they merit wrath a door opens for
mercy (10-11); and always he will act for the sake of his name
(12, 14). To such a God prayer can be made confidently for such
a people. The prayer is in seven sections.
Where is God’s love? (63:15-16). The remembrancer’s first
memory (7) becomes a question: if the Lord’s love never
changes, where is it now? — especially (15ab) since the Lord
remains the Sovereign One! As God in heaven he dominates the
earth (40:22-24); neither his authority (lofty throne) nor his
character (holy ... glorious) has altered, so why has he apparently
changed in his concern (zeal), in his warrior might competent to
deal with every foe, and in his tender compassion? Tenderness
points to being moved by felt inward emotions. Compassion: see
verse 7f. Abraham ... Israel: in 48:1-2 the charge was laid that
the people could no longer validly claim to be Israel; here that
charge is acknowledged as right: cf Deuteronomy 33:9, where
the same verbs (know ... acknowledge) are used in the sense of
detachment from family relationships and refusal of family
obligations. Yet, even if the ancestors disown their descendants,
surely the Lord is still Father ... Father ... Redeemer. In Egypt
he claimed Israel as his son (Ex. 4:22), pledged himself to
redeem (Ex. 6:6—-7), and declared that his name, thus revealed,
was eternally true (Ex. 3:15).
Why does the Lord remain alienated? (63:17-19). 17. Make
us wander is not an attempt to lay the blame on the Lord, rather a
recognition that the guilt of his people is such that the Lord had
no option but to drive them from him and into the far country of
sin which they had chosen. Likewise harden our hearts does not
blame the Lord for our sin. The heart choosing disobedience
hardens progressively against God’s way until the moment
(known only to God and fixed by him) comes when the point of
no return is reached, when the final, decisive choice of sin is
made. When this point is passed the situation is humanly
irretrievable: only God can change it' — if only he will return.
1 Pharaoh’s heart is the classic place to study the question of heart-hardening.
Three verbs are used: Vhazaq, in the gal form, ‘to become hard’ (Ex. 7:13, 22;
8:19; 9:35) and in its piel form, ‘to make hard’ (4:21; 9:12; 10:20, 27; 11:10;
14:4, 8, 17); Vkabed, qal, ‘to be heavy, unresponsive’ (8:15, 32; 9:34; 10:1); and
Nasa, hiphil, ‘to make stubborn’ (7:3). The human act of deliberate disobedience
results in the hardening of heart, the disposing of the character and will towards
that line of action, with a diminishing power to act otherwise until, in the
sovereign decree of God, power of reformation is lost altogether. The three
389
ISAIAH 63:18 — 64:5
18-19. It is usual to claim that these verses must be postexilic, describing the return to a devastated. sanctuary (2.81:
25:8), but post-exilic experience is against this view: the return
was itself proof that the Lord was active in love on behalf of his
people. They could not, then, say “Where are your zeal ... might
... compassion?’ when their home-coming was evidence of it.
They could not cry out ‘Return’ since, very plainly, he had
already come back to them as their Restorer. We could envisage
these verses as a prayer of the exiles (somewhat like Ps. 137),
looking back in misery and forward in half-hope; but, were they
such, it would be impossible to explain their appearance here.
Isaiah, however, could pray this prayer. Either he could imaginatively project himself forward into the situation he had predicted (6:12—13; 39:8-9) and voice this prayer for a return of
divine mercy and transforming grace; or the verbs may be ‘perfects of certainty’: ‘For a while your people have possessed
... Our adversaries are sure to tread down ... we are to become ...’
Either way, he adopts the role of one longing for a change in
God, bringing new acts of rectification. Verse 19 is not straightforward to translate but, more literally rendered, says,
‘For a long time we have been those you did not rule over, on
whom your name had not been called.” The Hebrew virtually makes clauses into titles: ‘We have become “You did not rule them”, “Your name was not given them”.’ This is the essence of
the ‘land of wandering’, entered when the Lord judicially imposes the consequences of sin: it is as though they are now beyond the pale of his kingdom and guardian care and have lost
the intimacy of the shared name.
Why didn’t God do something? (64:1-3). The rules of
Hebrew require that verse 1 refer to the past: ‘Oh that you had rent cs ve all Tras Deen. reviewing_a_tragic_past (17-19). It
didn’t have to be like that; the Lord’s mere presence would have
altered everything! The rent heavens, trembling mountains and fre are the traditional motifs used to express the coming of the Holy One (Pss. 18:7ff.; 46:1ff.). And just as creation is helpless before him (1b), so are nations (2). The problem is perennial: are not we too baffled at the way he runs the world — when he could so easily do things so differently? Maybe it is too late to hope (64:4-5). The sad question with which this stanza ends faces the harshest reality. It is the central
statements that Pharaoh hardened his heart, God hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and Pharaoh’s heart became hard, view this procedure from different but interlocking points of view.
390
ISAIAH 64:6-9
stanza of the poem and raises the central issue. God indeed could
deal with any problem with consummate ease (1-3), but_wh should such a God intervene for such as wel in the Hebrew ancient times (4) and continue are the same word; God has
continued for ever — but so has sin! The issue of this dilemma is
no foregone conclusion. There are two conditions of blessing (4d,
Sab) but they have never been met. Neither the course of history
(ancient times) nor shared information (ear ... heard) nor
perception (eye ... seen) has brought another God into the picture.
But the only God has his principles and procedures. First, he acts
on behalf of those who wait. Wait (Vhaka) is synonymous with
(Ngawa) (3, cf. 40:31); both, at their purest, refer to patient,
confident, expectant faith, a faith truly ‘simple’ in its unwavering
trust in the divine promises. Secondly, there is the moral
requirement of doing right (Sab). On the one side, the perfect
tense, come, expresses a set characteristic; on the other side, the
participles in gladly (lit. ‘rejoice and’) do right express an
unchanging state covering both heart and life, emotional and
practical obedience. The verbs sin and angry are perfect tenses —
it was your fixed mind to be angry and ours to continue in sin.
What a collision course! So is salvation possible?
Sin and helplessness (64:6-7). In verses 1b and 2d, before
you conceals a reference to the Lord’s ‘face’. All he need do is
show his face and the nations would be helpless. But the reality is
rather that we shrivel (6c) and waste away (7d) because of his
hidden face (7c). This is both the inner and personal and the
spiritual and eternal consequence of sin. We perish because he is
alienated. As to sin which has these dire consequences, it is
uncleanness (6a). Unclean is the leper’s cry (Lv. 13:45), and the
word speaks of unfitness for the fellowship of God and exclusion
from the Lord’s people. Sin is the defilement which a fallen
nature imparts to all we do. Filthy rags is (lit.) ‘a garment of
thenstruation’; bodily discharges were considered a defilement,
because they were the ‘outflow’ of a sinful, fallen human nature.
So, even what we might consider to be in our favour, righteous
acts, partake of the defilement of fallenness. Sin brings decay and
death like a leaf. There is an inherent destructiveness in sin
whereby it sweeps us away. Sin is lack of interest in the Lord: it
is of no importance to bring him into our lives and needs by
calling on his name. Strives is ‘rouses himself’, ‘wakes from
sleep’. Life without a living relationship with God is the life of
sleep! And because of all this, the Lord is alienated (hidden your
face) and antagonized (made us waste). ia ;
The unchanged God (64:8-9). In his holy hostility to sin and

€ relationship of Father (8) to his children is permanent:
through all the vicissitudes of family life the relationship itself
cannot be erased. The potter.cannot disown the pot — it is there
only because he made it — nor can the artisan (your hand) disown
the artefact (work). Again, this is not to shift blame on to God for
our failure, but to assert a permanent relationship — the love of
the father, the sovereign decision of the potter, the skill of the
craftsman. The children may always ask to come home; the pot may seek refashioning in the hand of the potter. In verse 6, all of
us ... we all uses the same Hebrew word twice as confession;
here, in we ... all, it comes twice as plea. Beyond measure:
(lit.) ‘unto muchness’, meaning ‘in all its inherent energy’, i.e.
‘do not let your anger have full play’. The end of the old — achanged moral reaction (angry) and an erased memory (remember) — is matched by the onset of the new divine attitude
(look upon us) and a revivified divine memory (we are all your
people).
Can love still be withheld? (64:10-12). The reference to
desolate cities, a burnt-out house and precious things in ruins
suggests the situation to which the exiles returned from Babylon,
as indeed they did; but the prayer in verse 12 is not one they could have used. Their very return was proof that the Lord had
not restrained himself or remained silent. How could they pray
about punishment beyond measure when their return proved that
punishment was already over? Furthermore, the problem in the
immediate post-exile was not divine but human inaction — the
carelessness that left the house unbuilt (Hg. 1:2-3). The
alternatives of interpretation here are the same as in 63:18-19:
either an exilic plea, or an Isaianic meditation. As we noted in
chapter 39, the Babylonian prediction was undated but was a live
option within Isaiah’s lifetime. Inevitably he would face — and
others would make him face — the rigour of what he has
predicted. A poem such as this is just the guidance needed for
coming uncharted days. The verbs are best taken, then, as perfects of certainty: ‘your sacred cities are to become ...’ efc. 12. Afier suggests sequence in time (i.e. after these things have happened), but the Hebrew means ‘in response to such eventualities’. The verb hold back appeared in 63:15 in the first: stanza of the poem. There the intercessors knew themselves to be the cause of the ‘withholding’, but in the course of the poem sin has been exposed and the Lord has been sought in penitence. The wonder of repentance is that it works — so will not the Lord now
392
ISAIAH 65:1
leap into action and create a new situation that will transcend the
ruins of the past? It is to this topic that Isaiah turns in the
remaining two chapters.
b. The Lord responding: sure promises, coming
consummation (65:1 — 66:24)
These chapters provide a fitting conclusion both to The Book of
the Conqueror (chs. 56 — 66) and indeed the book of Isaiah as a
whole. The prayer of the remembrancer (63:7 — 64:12) ended
with the Lord’s people waiting and longing for the remedial work
of God. The ruins in which they find themselves living are the
fruits of their own failure — all that was exposed in chapters 56 —
58 and acknowledged in 59:1-13. Only the coming of the
Conqueror (59:14 — 63:6) can redeem the people, relieve them of
their foes, and restore their fortunes. How great that restoration
will be is now revealed.
j. Pleading and provocation (65:1—-10). The contrast which
becomes more and more emphatic as these two final chapters
proceed is established here. There are those who ‘seek’ the Lord
(1; lit. ‘I have let myself be sought’, not revealed myself) and
who meet with blessing (8-9); there are those who refuse his
appeal (2) and meet with requital (6-7).
The Lord’s world initiative (65:1). The Lord asserts that he
has taken the initiative towards people who neither asked for him
nor sought him. Who are they? Majority opinion understands
them to be Israelites who have failed to respond. The actual terms
of the verse are, however, against this. There was no time when
Israel could be described as a nation that did not call on my
name, for there were always those who did call; even if we
understand the words to imply ‘but not sincerely’, the accusation
is still too sweeping; and even if it were not, there is nothing in
the Hebrew to warrant importing the required thought of
insincerity. Furthermore, did not call alters MT (from qoéra’ to
qara’). MT says ‘a nation not called by my name’, plainly
excluding Israel who were so called (43:7). On the other hand,
the apparent meaning — the Lord’s call of grace to the Gentiles
(Rom. 10:20) — forms here an inclusio with the reference to the
nations who ‘have not heard of my fame’ and who gather to the
Lord in 66:18-21. Towards these the Lord has taken an initiative:
(lit.) ‘let myself be sought ... let myself be found’ (tolerative
niphals). (Cf Jn. 15:16.) He has reached out through his word
(I said), acted in self-revelation (Here am I, lit. “Behold me!’)
and brought them within the embrace of the revelation granted to
393
ISAIAH 65:2-3
Israel (name, Ex. 3:15). Looking back to the eunuch and alien
in 56:14, 8, and the ingathering Gentiles of 60:3, Isaiah sees
here the fruit of the extension of the gospel of God to all the
world. Provocation and penalty (65:2-7). Verse 1 leads into 2ff.
through the truth enunciated in Ezekiel 3:6: namely that the guilt
of Israel is deepened because those who did not enjoy their
privileges none the less embraced so promptly the revelation of
God once it came to them (cf Mt. 21:31-32). Commentators recognize that the religious corruptions mentioned (3-5) belong
to the pre-exile (1:28-30; Je. 2:20, 27; 3:2, 6, 13; Ezk. 8:1-18;
16:1ff.; Mi. 5:12-14) and were not found in post-exilic Israel, yet, inexplicably, many still ascribe these verses to a post-exilic prophet.’ They are, however, comfortable in the mouth of Isaiah,
who here uses pre-exilic evidences as stereotypes in order to
expose the continuance of religious apostasy into the future. (Cf 65:11-12; 66:1-4, 15-17.) 2-3. Israel’s apostasy is seen, first, in the refusal of a
wonderfully condescending appeal. Held (‘spread’) out my hands
is elsewhere used of prayer (1:15; 1 Ki. 8:22). So desirous is the
Lord to win his people that he deigns to become a suppliant! But
he is met by stubborn rebellion (obstinate, Vsarar: Efe 23):
Secondly, this rejection arises from self-confident adoption of
an individualistic lifestyle based on personal imaginations
(‘thoughts, plans’) and issuing in conduct not good. Divine
revelation, the basic ‘reality’ of the people of God (Am. 2:4), has
been ousted from its fundamental position and replaced by the
relativism of individual preference. Isaiah traces this out (3ff.) as
contradicting, one by one, the commandments of the Decalogue.
In the first commandment, they were commanded to have ‘no
other gods before me’ (‘al pdnay, Ex. 20:3), but they offered
provocation fo my very face (‘al panay). Sacrifices in gardens:
the ‘garden’ (cf 1:28ff.) symbolizes fertility, and the worship of
the so-called ‘fertility gods’ involved the replacement of Yahweh
by Baal or the addition of Baal functions to Yahweh. The second commandment dealt with outward forms of worship. Brick was an unauthorized material (Ex. 20:25; Dt. 27:5-6; Jos. 8:31) — what humans made or shaped became infected with their unclean sinfulness. But disobedience often begins thus, at a point where obedience would be easy (e.g. to build an altar of uncut stone) but is considered unimportant.
! The so-called ‘Third Isaiah’ was supposedly responsible for the material in chs. 56 — 66,
394
ISAIAH 65:4-7
4-5. Beyond the outward trappings of religion (‘gardens’ and
‘altars’), Isaiah now probes the deeper matter of spiritual loyalty.
The third commandment specified the pledging of allegiance to
the Lord’s name only — the Lord as he revealed himself — but the
Lord’s people are found among the graves. For the purpose of
necromancy, they spend ... their nights keeping secret vigil,
literally ‘in guarded places’, ie. secure from interruption, the
living finding spiritual guidance among the dead! (Cf 8:19-20;
Dt. 18:9ff.) The fourth commandment dealt with the distinction
between the ordinary and the holy, but they developed their own
notions of holiness (4c—5b). What the Lord forbade (Lv. 11:7, Dt.
14:8) they practised (4cd), and cultivated a holiness of élitism, a
first-class citizenship, an exclusivistic approach to spirituality. No
wonder such are a constant irritant, smoke in my nostrils (Scd)!
They cultivate other gods (3a-c), flout even his simplest worship
requirements (3d), resort to other sources of revelation (4ab),
neglect the obedience factor in the separated life (4cd) and adopt
a spirituality of pride (Sab). The all day of the Lord’s appeal (2)
is paralleled by the all day of their provocation (5).
6—7. The Lord’s reaction is decided upon (written), personal (I
will), measured (pay back in full), individual (/aps) and a final
settlement of sins, both personal and ancestral. In Scripture, sin
becomes more aggravated with each succeeding generation — not
that coming generations are pre-doomed by the sins of the past
(Ezk. 18), but that failure to break with the past involves bearing
the entail of the past (Lk. 11:47-51). This is the price of being
human. Because introduces a concluding summary. Worship on
the mountains is exclusively pre-exilic — the exposed mountaintop being chosen as more likely to ‘catch Baal’s eye’ and prompt
a response. Canaanite religion was human initiative pressuring
the god, as compared with the biblical religion of obedience
responding to divine grace.
Blessings for the remnant (65:8-10). Not all participate in
verses 2-7. The community was divided. The theory of a ‘Third
Isaiah’ makes this party division a special mark of the post-exile,
but in fact there is nothing here that goes beyond, for example,
1:26ff.; 8:11-20; 10:20-23 (cf. 4:3; 6:11-13; Je. ADT: S:10.818;
30:11; Ezk. 11:13-20). We can find here a different doctrine of
the remnant, or a different application of the doctrine of the
remnant, only if we first invent post-exilic circumstances. In the
dark days of Isaiah’s ministry the remnant would have prized
these words of comfort. Three reassuring pictures are sketched:
the vintage (8) depicts delighted preservation, the land (9) depicts
possession, and Sharon and Achor (10) depict renewal.
39)
ISAIAH 65:8-12
8. Juice (tiros) is wine made from the first drippings of the
juice before the press was trodden.' Found suggests that the
grapes were oozing as they were picked and that this was
specially prized. Hence there is some good (lit.) ‘there is a
blessing’. Marvellously, then, the Lord finds: his people a
blessing, and he prizes and guards them. All merit the winepress
of 63:3, but some are chosen and saved. ;
9-10. Possess ... inherit: the same word twice, repeated to
denote certainty. The picture is of Joshua’s people entering in to
possess (Jos. 1:1-5). Chosen ... servants: the two sides of the
same reality: the sovereign fact of divine choice, and the
responsive reality and commitment within a new status (54:17;
57:18-19). Isaiah uses Sharon to typify deterioration (33:9) and
renewal (35:2). Achor (Jos. 7:24-26) symbolizes a bright
beginning marred by disobedience. But the time is coming when
Sharon will be what it was meant to be and Achor transformed
from curse to blessing. Seek: those gathered from the world (1)
and those preserved from the people (10) share one characteristic
— their diligence to enjoy the divine presence.
ii. Contrasting destinies (65:11—-16). 11-12. The reference to
mountain (11b) looks back to the mountain religion of verse 7.
The Lord’s mountain was where he built his house, made his
home and indwelt his people; it was the place ‘sought’ by those
who loved him (Dt. 12:5). Others rejected Zion and favoured the
mountains of Baal. But to forget the mountain was to forsake the
LorD. When he appoints means by which he is to be approached
(Heb. 10:19), everything else leads away from him. Spread a
table ... fill bowls exposes the silliness of false religion: gods who
need to be wined and dined and are yet considered arbiters of
Fortune and Destiny! Fortune (gad) was a Canaanite god (cf. the
place-names in Jos. 11:17; 15:37), worshipped in the pre-exile.
Destiny (m‘ni), ‘apportionment’ (of fate),? is a noun derived from
the verb Vmand, which appears in J will destine. The destiny they
chose was the destiny they received; the dead gods brought the
sentence of death. There were two reasons for this outcome: refusal of the Lord’s word (12cd), and contradiction of the Lord’s way (12ef). Their response contradicted the will (J called), the
' See F. S. Fitzsimmonds, ‘Wine’, in NBD, p.1242. | 2 C. Westermann is typical of the post-exilic fixation of commentators on chs. 56 — 66: ‘A charge of open idolatry is surprising in the post-exilic period. It might hint that both the oracle ... in verses 9f and ... in verses 11—12a were simply taken over from tradition’ (Isaiah 40 — 66 [SCM, 1966], p. 405). But why should they be ‘taken over’ if they were totally inapplicable and unsuited?
396
ISAIAH 65:13-16
word (J spoke), the mind (in my sight) and the heart (displeases,
lit. ‘I did not delight’) of God.
Verses 13-16 draw a conclusion (Therefore, 13), and the stark
contrasts of the alternative destinies are worked out in verses 13-
15. My servants looks back to ‘my servants’, the remnant in 8—
10, and you (masculine plural) continues from the address to
‘you’ in 11-12. Verse 16 states the outcome objectively.
13-15. Eat ... drink (13a-d) match 25:6-9; 55:1-2. The
contrasts of hunger and thirst picture the meeting of every
physical need, and the use Isaiah makes of this motif transfers it
to the realm of spiritual need and supply. The externality of
eating and drinking is balanced by the internal contrast of sing ...
joy and cry out ... anguish (14). To sing is to enter joyfully into a
proffered benefit, and those who do so find inner fulfilment. But,
by contrast, those who refused the Lord, his word and his way
(12c-f) find that they have condemned themselves to shame
(disappointment, non-fulfilment), anguish (pain and grief at the
very heart of experience), and brokenness of spirit (the breakdown of every vital energy and purposeful activity). Even to
recall those who rejected the Lord will be as bleak as dwelling on
the Lord’s curse (15), which has reached its inevitable outcome
in death. Put you: the you-plural which has prevailed since verse
11 suddenly changes to you-singular. Divine judgment falls
individually. But, by contrast to the name which matches the
curse, there is another name, not revealed, indicating the gift of a
new nature and the inheritance of the promises of God — as with
Abram (Gn. 17:2-8).
16. The new name makes a new person with new potentialities
and prospects. Invokes a blessing is reflexive, and this should be
made explicit by adding ‘on himself’. The same verb expresses
the universal Abrahamic promise (Gn. 22:8; 26:4). The idea is of
entering into the blessing appropriate to one’s needs. Land: in the
light of the links with Abraham, ‘earth’ would be better, the
realization at last of a world at one with God. In parallel to (lit.)
‘invokes on himself the blessing he needs’, there is takes an oath,
ie. ‘swears loyalty’, ‘makes his commitment’. The God of truth
is both the source of blessing and the great object of devotion.
God of truth is (lit.) ‘the God of (the) Amen’ (explained by 2 Cor.
1:20), the God who says ‘amen’ to all his promises, affirming
their reality and his trustworthiness to keep them: the God who
promised of old in Abraham that a worldwide people would find
the blessing they needed and who will keep his word. Forgotten

mind (forgotten) or presence (eyes) no longer has any ground of

being. The old has passed away — behold (see 17-25 below), all
things have become new (2 Cor. 5:17; Rev. Bid):
iii. All things new (65:17—25)
The new creation (65:17-18b). The purpose of this short
poem is to explain the promises in verses 13-16, so the initial
‘For’ of verse 17 should be restored. Create: see 4:5. Heavens ...
earth: totality expressed by contrast (Gn. 1:1). Everything the
Lord created at the beginning will be made new at the end.
Former picks up ‘past’ (lit. ‘former’, 16e) but the conception is
now grander: not only its sorrows but everything in the old order,
dimmed and diminished as it was by the infection of human sin,
will undergo this great renewal. Remembered ... mind: not now
the divine mind (16ef) but the mind of the redeemed, renewed
participants. Their awareness will be of total newness, in which
nothing prompls recollection of what once was. The new creation will be observed and enjoyed by new, fresh minds. All (U will
create) is the work of God, a work of such greatness and newness
that no other agent could unt t. It will be eternal (for Ser andinithae any iivscion eas its joy. Note how this
delightful little poem begins (17a) and ends (18b) with J will
create, balances the new creation (17b) and those who inhabit it
(18a), and centres on total newness (17cd).
The new city (65:18c—20). This second compact poem
describes the joy of the Creator (18c—19b), the experience of the
citizens (19c—20e) and the unchanged moral factor (20fg).
18c—19b. The new creation (17) is now Jerusalem, the new city. The city (Gn. 11:1-9) was humankind’s earliest effort to organize the world for its own security and stability. With Isaiah
we watched the same human urge move from the imperialist
Babylon that he knew (chs. 13 — 14), to the Babylon principle at
work in ongoing history (21:1—10) and, at its end, to the fall of
the world city where meaning had ceased to exist (24:1-10). By
contrast he showed us another city — of joy and provision (25:6—
9), strength and salvation (26:1-3). It is in this way that the new
creation becomes the new Jerusalem: the Lord’s perfect
organization of his new creation as_a perfect setting for his new people. /ts people are my people. There is no _longer_a spiritual schizophrenia in the community, nor is there anything to cause sorrow or blight life: weeping is felt pain; crying (lit. ‘scream’) is inflicted pain. The emotion and its cause are both gone. 20. Throughout this passage Isaiah uses aspects of what we know to create impressions of what is to come — e.g. a life totally provided for (13), happy (19cd), secure (22-23), at peace (24—
398
ISAIAH 65:21—25
25). What we have no capacity to understand can be grasped only
through what we know. In this present order, death cuts life off.
Not so in the new Jerusalem: no infant will fail to come to maturity, nor the elderly be foiled of fulfilment. It is not meant to
soci goek death all oi be prcsent-This would one
ever (18), no more and the death of death in 25:7-8. It
simply affirms that, over the whole of life, the power of death
wall be gone The only exception is that (lit.) ‘the sinner, a hundred years old, will be accursed’ (20fg). There will, of course, be
no sinners in the new Jerusalem (6-7, 12, 15c). We are again
dealing with metaphor: even if, per impossibile, a sinner were to
escape detection for a century, the curse would still search him
out and destroy him. In reality, just as death will have no more
power, so sin too will have r 5
The new society (65:21-25). The society to come will know
security of tenure (21-22), fulfilment in blessing (23), peace with
God (24) and total harmony (25).
21-22. To build and not inhabit was the fate of the disobedient
(Dt. 28:30). The opposite experience, theref i age 4
the days of a tree pictures longevity and durability, ie. a secure
hold on location. Long enjoy is (lit.) ‘wear out’, Ze. ‘use to the
absolute maximum, enjoy to the limit’.
23. Within the security of verses 21-22 there will be cloudless
enjoyment of that for which they laboured. Doomed to
misfortune: literally ‘for terror’. There is no darker parental cloud
than to see a dear child touched with tragedy. Such will never be
the case in the new society, ‘for they will be a seed blessed by the
Lord’ (cf, 53:10; Gn. 17:7). Their descendants with them: parents
will not see their children troubled, but they will see them at one
with themselves in the things of God.
24-25. The common thought in these verses is oneness: first
oneness with the Lord, as he anticipates their needs (24a) and,
ecause they are in such harmony with his will, the words they
use commend themselves to him for immediate action (24b).
Secondly, harmony prevails throughout creation (25), as Eden is
restored (11:6—-9), old enmities are gone (wolf), fears removed
(lamb) and natures changed (/ion ... eat straw). In 11:69 there is
no reference to the great enemy of creation, the serpent (Gn.
3:14), but it is accurately in place here. There is a point in the
new creation where nothing changes: the curse upon sin still
stands. The Lord is still the Holy God. Neither harm nor destroy:
the positives of 25ab are strengthened by the negatives of 25de,
ruling out both damage (harm) and destruction (destroy). The
399
ISAIAH 66:1—2b
whole is my holy mountain (cf. 11), the place where the Lord in
holiness dwells among his people, and they with him.
iv. Judgment and hope (66:1-24). The broad theme of
Isaiah’s final chapter follows on from the vision of the new
heaven and new earth. How will the wrath to come be avoided
and a confidence attained of enjoyment of the glory to come?
Chapter 66 is best understood by looking first at the shape of
the whole. It begins (1-4) and ends (18-24) with the theme of the
house of the Lord. In the opening section, Isaiah moves quickly
from the house itself (1-2) to contrasting worshippers — those
who ‘tremble at my word’ (2), and those who, though they
engage in the ritual (3), do not answer when the Lord calls (4). In
the closing passage, Isaiah starts with a worldwide pilgrimage
bringing a pure offering to the Lord’s house (18-21), and ‘all
mankind’ keeping Sabbath (22-23). But, by contrast, there are
those upon whom the final judgment of God has fallen (24). The
two internal sections of the chapter deal respectively with these
two groups of people: a message of assurance and hope for ‘those
who tremble’ at the Lord’s word (5-14), and the Lord’s fiery
judgment on the false worshippers (15-17). The Lord’s ‘house’
is, of course, the ‘place’ where he comes to live at the centre of
his people’s life. This is his ‘tabernacle’, his tent-dwelling at the
heart of his people’s ‘encampment’. As Isaiah teaches, there is
but one proper response to the presence of this ‘house’ and its
holy Occupant: do we tremble at his word, or do we refuse him when he calls?
The house and its people (66:14). 1-2ab. Solomon provides
us with the perspective we need for these verses. In his dedicatory prayer (1 Ki. 8:12—29) he asked the key question: ‘Will God really dwell on earth?’ (27) The whole context of that ques- tion demands the answer ‘Yes’: he affirms the house as a divine
400
ISAIAH 66:2c—4
2c-e. This is the one I esteem is a good interpretative rendering, but a more literal translation is ‘But to this one I will
look’. The Lord has to ask directions to find the house (lcd;
Where ...?, ’é-zeh), but he has no problem spotting people (2c; ‘to this one’, ’e/-zeh). The Lord will graciously, condescendingly,
make the miniscule house his home. The humble are, socially,
those who are at the bottom of life’s heap, dominated by stronger
forces and interests; religiously, they are those who willingly take
the lowest place before God. Contrite (n°kéh): ‘lamed’ (2 Sa.
9:3), or disabled, here used with spiritual significance: one who is
aware of the damage wrought by sin, of personal inability to
stand upright before God. Zrembles speaks of a sensitive,
concerned longing to please. (The verb Vharéd and its adjective
are used in 2 Ki. 4:13 of the caring and painstaking trouble to
which the Shunnamite woman went to get everything ready for
Elisha, but Ezr. 9:4 and 10:3 match this use in Isaiah.) This, then,
is what looms large before the Lord’s gaze: our lowliness before
him in worship, our self-awareness and our painstaking
sensitivity to his word.
3. Four pairs of permissible acts of worship are matched with
impermissible ones. Throughout, the words like and is like one
who presents (3f) are interpretative additions. Leaving them out,
we find that Isaiah simply sets lawful and unlawful actions side
by side without comment: one slaughters a bull, but one kills a
man (i.e. sinful action); one sacrifices a lamb, but one strangles a
dog (i.e. meaningless); one brings a gift of grain, but another
brings pig’s blood (i.e. unacceptable); one makes an incense
memorial, someone else blesses an idol (i.e. apostate). According
to Ezekiel 8, pre-exilic worship went hand in hand with just such
deviations. Isaiah’s purpose is to present the element of choice:
the Lord has made his will known in his word. He is not
repudiating the place and use of sacrifices (as the words /ike, etc.,
suggest); he is contrasting the revealed way in the matter of
worship with human ways, and his accusation is (3ij) is that some
have chosen and ordered their worship accordingly (ways); this is
no outward formality but involves their hearts (delight). But to
the Lord it was abominations (Siqqiis) — everything he detested!
4. The divine response is exact: they ‘have chosen’ (31); now
he will choose. Harsh treatment: in 3:4 ta““lilim meant unpredictable capriciousness; here, probably, sudden or summary
treatment, rather than harsh. Dread suggests that they flew to
their religious practices as a protective technique (cf. 65:11). Far
from protecting, however, false religion provokes what it would
prevent. But the heart of the matter was refusal of the Lord’s
401
ISAIAH 66:5-9
declared will (J called), plain word (J spoke) and practical
directive (did evil).
The word of God and eternal security (66:5-6). Those who
tremble at the Lord’s word are now scorned (5-6), but they will
rejoice and flourish (14) because the Lord has made promises to
Zion of children (7-9) and peace (12-13), and in Zion mourning
will be turned to joy and rich provision (10-11). Tremble: cf
verse 2; here it is the key to divine blessing, the hallmark of the
true believer. Brothers: in the formal sense of belonging to the
same religious community. Here is the same hostility as in 5:18—
19 (cf 29:9-10); the same two parties with the same contrast between seeking the cults and seeking the Lord as in 8:11—20; the
same outcome of wrath (8:21—22) and glory (9:2ff.). Because of
my name: exclusion was based both on rejection of what the
‘word tremblers’ understood by the name, and on infatuation with
what the others wished the name to mean. They really thought
that the name of the Lord was more truly understood and more
perfectly honoured in their self-chosen theologies than by loyalty
to the Lord’s word. In particular, the ‘word tremblers’ profess a coming joy, but their hope is thrown back in their faces (cf 2 Pet
3:3). Yet time will justify their eschatology, as city and temple resound with the uproar of divine requital (6).
Impossible for people, possible for God (66:7-—9).
Eschatology is one of the major points at which those who accept
the Bible’s testimony are still subject to scorn. It was evidently
the same in Isaiah’s day, and consequently he moves from
affirming eschatological certainty (6) to affirm that what seems
impossible to the human mind is yet God’s simplicity. Can there
be birth without labour, children without pain (7), a country and
nation born instantaneously (8a-d)? But it will be so (8ef, 9)!
Everything comes down to what the Lord is (9). First, he is
faithful to the end: he does not advance his purposes (bring to the
moment of birth) only to abandon them; secondly, he is
sovereign: what he initiates he completes — (lit.) ‘Do I beget and
(then) close (the womb)?’, start what I do not intend to finish?
Give delivery and bring to delivery are the same word (hiphil
participle, Vyalad) but the meaning bring to delivery (i.e. preside over the period of gestation up to the birth) is unexemplified. It means either ‘beget’ (the moment of conception) or ‘cause to bring forth’ (the moment of birth). The latter suits verse 9b and the former 9cd. Says ... says: the former is imperfect tense, ‘keeps saying’, a usage peculiar to Isaiah among the prophets (1:11, 18; 33:10; 40:1, 25; 41:21); the latter is perfect tense, something said and settled. Suitably to the illustrations, the Lord
402
ISAIAH 66:10-14
persists in what he has declared (imperfect tense), and what he
ee declared is backed by a sovereign commitment (perfect tense)
to do it.
Joy and provision (66:10-11). Present attitudes to Jerusalem
are ambivalent: joy in the city of God — the place of his house
and presence, worship, fellowship, atonement — all the great
spiritual verities centred in Zion, even now, for its members
(Heb. 12:22-23); and yet mourning — over a divided community,
opposition to true, biblical religion, the scorn of the world for the
people of God, the denial of eschatological hope. But a different
time is coming, in which all that Zion means will be offered and
enjoyed to the full. There is a double picture of the maternal
breasts of Jerusalem: the first stresses the satisfaction of the
infant (1lab); the second, the more than sufficient abundance of
the mother, (lit.) ‘the nipple of her glory’.
The world city of peace (66:12—-13). The Lord’s promises rest
on the sole guarantee of his word, for this is what the LORD says.
Peace ... like a river was what they lost through refusal of the
Lord’s word (48:18), but all that was lost by sin will be
recovered, and the long story of peace (48:22; 52:7; 53:5; 54:10,
13; 55:12; 57:2, 19, 21; 59:8; 60:17) will reach its conclusion: the
river will flow again. Nations ... stream: in 2:2 the nations came
‘streaming’ to Zion, and this is no illusory vision. Wealth is
‘glory’, and as ‘the glory of the Lord’ means ‘the Lord in all his
glory’, so in the Zion that is yet to be (Rev. 21:24-26) every
nation will be present ‘in all its glory’, ie. the glory of what it
was meant to be and will be when its individuality is brought to
mature perfection in the city of God. Flooding (VSatap) was
Isaiah’s typical metaphor of the Assyrian threat (8:8; 10:22; 28:2,
15, 17-18; 30:28). The measure of international threat to Zion
will become the measure of international enrichment of the city.
In 49:23; 60:4, the nations fostered Zion’s children — a picture of
their willing acceptance of servant membership. But coming into
Zion, it is they who, as true, full children (Ps. 87), themselves
experience Zion’s maternal care — nursed and carried (12c),
cuddled (12d) and comforted (13a). The real source, however, of
all the comfort is the Lord (13c), found only (lit.) ‘in Jerusalem’,
the ‘Solid joys and lasting treasure/ None but Zion’s children
know’.
Settlement (66:14). When you see matches and cancels out
the scornful ‘may we see!’ (lit.) of verse Sef. To ‘see’ is to
experience personally and directly. In the eternal Zion this is an
1 From J. Newton, ‘Glorious things of thee are spoken’.
403
ISAIAH 66:15—17
experience which cannot be taken away — because (14cd) the
same hand (personal, intervening action) which will bring perfect
bliss is matched by the anger with which the Lord has dealt with
his foes. Verse 14 thus cancels out 5. While the Lord’s servants
live in a spiritually divided community, joy is ever under threat,
and therefore never enjoyed for long or to the full. But divine
action will at one and the same time secure eternal joy and
remove every threat. It is the day of vengeance and salvation of
63:1-6. The holy and jealous God (66:15-17). The sharp tension
evident in verses 5-6 between the ‘word tremblers’ and the
compromisers sketched a situation demanding settlement one
way or the other. The Lord responded by declaring his hand. He
is always on the side of those who love his word, and for them
there lie ahead the joy, comfort, abundance and worldwide
fellowship of verses 7—14ab. That the Lord should be angry with
the compromisers (14cd) is implied, but what form will his anger
take? The answer is clear when the initial ‘For’ (removed by NIV)
of verse 15 is restored. Verses 15-16 present a stylized presentation of divine visitation in anger, and 17 (cf 65:3-5) makes
a direct application to the compromisers.
15-16. The main components of this terrifying theophany are
fire (1Sad, 16a), whirlwind (15b) and sword (16a). The leading
motif, fire, represents, as always the active holiness of God,
roused against sin. The whirlwind is his sweeping, irresistible
wind of judgment that leaves nothing behind — linked here with
chariots to depict pursuit as of mobile warfare, leaving no
escape. The sword is the application of judgment individually. In
Scripture, the whole sweep of human history lies between this
fire and this sword of holiness (Gn. 3:24; Is. 27:1). Thus the Lord
will execute judgment, ‘exert his judicial right’. Judgment is the
enforcement of total righteousness — the righteousness which the
Lord donned as a robe in 59:17 and then bequeathed to his
Anointed (61:10), who himself returned from the winepress of
wrath ‘speaking in righteousness’. Every act of God is pure righteousness, and it will be so when he turns at the end to deal with all men (lit. ‘all flesh’). _ 17. But, in particular, the apostates of the present context are singled out, the compromisers among the professing people of God, the worshippers who follow their own pleasure and do not respond to his call, listen to his word or walk in his way (66:4). When people cease to heed revealed truth, it is not that they then believe nothing, but that they will believe anything — gardens, pigs, rats, whatever! On gardens: cf. 1:28-31; 65:2-5
404
ISAIAH 66:18-19
Consecrate concerns the state of the person; purify is their fitness
to stand before God. Following the one in the midst has its
nearest parallel in Ezekiel 8:7—11 — the worshipping elders with
‘Jaazaniah standing in the midst’. We do not know enough about
ancient worship forms to pursue the matter further. It sounds like
a worshipping group with a central leader, but there must be more
to it than that, maybe some cultic significance which made it
abhorrent to the Lord. But the total picture and its meaning are
clear. The Lord is a jealous God, and worship must conform to
his revealed will if it is to render to him the worth and honour
that are his due. In default of this there is a roused and holy
jealousy working in judgment.
The new house at the centre of the new creation (66:18—
24). This final passage makes a necessary link with 66:1, the
foundational thought of the whole chapter. The mark of worship
is whether or not people were trembling at God’s word (2c-4).
Indeed, we might trace a progression from the new creation
(65:17) to the new city (65:19) to the new society (65:20ff.) and,
finally, to the new house (66:1). It is no surprise, therefore, that
Isaiah brings his eschatological vision to its climax in a worshipping people: envisaged (18-19), enjoying equal acceptance
in Jerusalem (20-22), and in constant communion with the Lord
(23-24).
18. The opening sentence here is an unresolved conundrum. It
seems like disconnected words: ‘And I their deeds and their
thoughts it has come.’ Have some connecting words been lost? Is
the whole context in a disorganized state, leaving these words
isolated like driftwood? Or is this idiomatic or colloquial Hebrew
that is beyond our reach? NIV makes what sense it can by
inserting because of and adjusting the verb come to make it refer
to the coming of the Lord. In so far as it helps, this has the
support of LXX. Yet it creates an insuperable problem: for any
coming of the Lord because of our actions cannot but be a
coming in judgment, and the glory would then be that of the
Judge. But this cannot be so: the glory (18) leads to a gathered
people acceptable to the Lord. Since, therefore, we are obliged to
make what we can of the text, a harmonizing suggestion (and
only a suggestion) is to make / and imaginations (lit. ‘thoughts”)
look back to what precedes, and glory to look on to what follows:
‘As for me regarding their words and their thoughts, it has come.
Now, to gather all nations ... they will come and see my glory.’
The work of vengeance is done; here is the parallel work of
salvation (59:17; 61:2; 63:4).
19. The Lord will gather the nations, not by a banner lifted
405
ISAIAH 66:20
afar (1:12-13; 49:22; 62:10) but by a sign among them, around
which they rally. Isaiah does not say what the sign is, but since in
its biblical context this passage lies in the interim between the
two comings of Jesus, the sign can only be the cross. J will send
is the Old Testament’s expression of the New Testament missionary mandate. Broadly, 2:2=4 summarizes the Old Testament
ideal: a community of the word of God, magnetic to the surrounding world; Matthew 28:19-20 summarizes the New Testament ideal: an outreaching church. Each is equally important in the total biblical view, but here the Lord sends (as once
he sent Isaiah) those who survive, ‘the escapees’. In context,
these are the people whom the judgment of God (16) does not
touch, those for whom the work of God is not vengeance but salvation, who have heard the cry of ‘Peace, peace’ and exercised
the gift of penitence (57:19). Some of these are now his
missionaries worldwide, as the impressionistically chosen place
names are intended to suggest. Zarshish: see 2:26; 23:1; 60:9.
Libyans ... Lydians: (lit.) Pul and Lud, mentioned along with
Cush in Jeremiah 46:9 and Ezekiel 30:5. The link with Cush is thought by some to suggest a southern location, but most agree
with NIV. Tubal was in the far north (Ezk. 39:1) and Greece is
Javan. Famous as archers: why should this be mentioned? Possibly just to balance the vagueness of the place-names with a
reminder that the missionaries go to real people who may
represent a real threat — organized, independent people, ready to ~ resist. Islands stand for ‘earth’s remotest bounds’ (11:11; 40:15;
60:9). There is no suggestion that such might have a religion ‘good enough for them’, or have enough truth to be going on with, or that Yahweh might perhaps be present incognito in their theology and ritual. The fact is that they know nothing and have
seen nothing of him, and this constitutes the reason for the
missionary mandate. Neither revelation (heard of my fame) nor experience (seen my glory) has been theirs. They need the knowledge of the only true God.
20. Cf John 11:52. It would be a nonsense to make brothers refer to regathering Israelites. What an anticlimax to promise that such would become priests (21)! No, it is erstwhile Gentiles — now _become brothers (19:24-25; 45:14-25), fulfilling the promise of 56:8. Offering (minha): ‘gift’ is the broadest word of all the offering vocabulary. The missionaries return with a gift to the Lord — those whom their testimony has won from the nations. Horses ... camels: the transportation list is impressionistic. No distance or difficulty can stand in their way of reaching Jerusalem, because every mode of travel is put under contribution
406
ISAIAH 66:21-24
to get them there, and all will come safely to my holy mountain,
as acceptable to the Lord as the grain offerings he himself
authorized Israel to offer. And not only to the mountain: right to
(6e ‘pein (temple) itself, the divine abode, the Lord’s ‘home’
21. In 61:6, as a result of the work of the Anointed One, Israel
became a priestly people, fulfilling Exodus 19:6. The privilege is
extended. Just as in Isaiah’s day only some Israelites were priests
and Levites, but through them Israel was constituted as the Lord’s
priestly people, so now he foresees Gentiles incorporated on
equal terms, into equal privileges (Eph. 3:6).
22-23. The new creation, new city and new house constitute
the eternal climax of the Lord’s purposes. This is what J make, a
participle expressing the impending future: ‘I am in process of
making/am going to make’. This coming reality has all the
eternal validity of the Lord himself (endure before me). It is his
stated commitment (declares: ‘is the word of’, 1:24). The Lord’s
people are here, (lit.) ‘your seed and your name’, referring to the
Covenant Mediator of 59:21, the people of the Anointed Conqueror, brought into their inheritance by his work of vengeance
and salvation. They have the same permanence, eternal security
and assurance as the new creation itself, and they are specifically
the New Moon and Sabbath people. Isaiah ends with the two
feasts whose corruption distressed him at the beginning of his
book (1:13). They are feasts, not fasts: mourning is in the past,
joy is the eternal present. The people enter into the reality of a
worldwide community, acceptable in equality before the Lord
(56:1-8); they are now at last able to match the Lord’s requirements (58:1—14) in practical holiness. Each month as it comes
and each week as it comes is met by joyful dedication of life’s
programme to the Lord. Contextually, the locus of all this is
Jerusalem, but the thought of ‘all flesh’ (all mankind) in one place
shows that the prophet is thinking in terms of the world mountain
of 11:9 and the world city of chapters 25 — 26, the Zion to which
believers have already come (Heb. 12:22-23) and into which
they will yet enter through the gates (Rev. 22:14).
24, Remarkably there is a cemetery by the city, and when ‘all
flesh’ comes to worship they make a point to go out and look at
the fate from which they have been rescued. They enjoy the day
of salvation, but they do not allow themselves to forget the day of
vengeance. These are dead because the judgment of God is for
real: they are those ‘slain by the Lorb’ (16). The accusation
levelled and made out against them is that they rebelled: they
knew the word of the Lord but deliberately and wilfully went

their own way (4). Consequently, the worm in the bud — the heart
of rebellion, the corrupt, fallen nature — was the winner, and it is
their endless lot to live the life of corruption (their worm will not
die) under the endless antagonism of divine holiness, i.e. the
unquenched fire. On the lips of Jesus, these words are used to
express the burning ‘life’ of Gehenna (Mk. 9:43-48), and ultimately they become the reality of the second death, a final change
of place and state with continuity of person (Rev. 20:15). The
purpose of visiting the cemetery is not to gloat (it is too awful for
that), nor even to pity (though who could restrain pity?), but
rather to register again something Joathsome (déra’on, cf. Dn.
12:2), to be repelled and revolted; that is to say, to see again the
wages of sin and the fruit of rebellion, and thereby to be newly
motivated to obedience and love of the word of God. There is
also another thought which we noted in verse 14: it is part of the
saints’ sense of the reality of their security to be assured that the
Lord has dealt, finally and fully, with everything that could ever
threaten or blight their eternal joy.
