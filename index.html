									<h3>The Nicene Creed</h3>
									<p>We take the Nicene Creed as an acceptable summary of the faith, bearing in mind that baptism refers to a baptism by the Holy Spirit and apostolic refers to the teaching of the Apostles, not apostolic succession:</p>
                                    <p>We believe in one God,

the Father, the Almighty,
maker of heaven and earth,
of all that is, seen and unseen.

We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,

the only Son of God,
eternally begotten of the Father,
God from God, Light from Light,
true God from true God,
begotten, not made,
of one being with the Father;
through him all things were made.
For us and for our salvation
he came down from heaven:
was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary,
and became truly human.
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;
he suffered death and was buried.
On the third day he rose again
in accordance with the Scriptures;
he ascended into heaven
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,
and his kingdom will have no end.

We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,

who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified,
who has spoken through the prophets.
We believe in one holy and apostolic Church.
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
We look for the resurrection of the dead,
and the life of the world to come. Amen.</p>

									<h3>The Five Solas</h3>
									<p>The Five Solas are a summary of the foundations of Scriptural faith. They are:</p>
                                    <li>Scripture Alone</li>
                                    <li>Grace Alone</li>
                                    <li>Faith Alone</li>
                                    <li>Christ Alone</li>
                                    <li>For God's Glory Alone</li>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p>Here are verses from Scripture in defense of these pillars of the faith:</p>
                                    <p>Romans 3:4 (part): "Let God be true, and every human being a liar." Only the word of God is trustworthy. Men are fallible.</p>
                                    <p>Ephesians 2:8-9: "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."</p>
                                    <p>Romans 3:28: "For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law."</p>
                                    <p>John 14:6: "Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'"</p>
                                    <p>1 Corinthians 10:31: "So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God." (See also Isaiah 43:6–7.)</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-bible"></span>
									<h3>First Purpose</h3>
									<p>We exist to defend the faith of the faithful. 1 Peter 3:15 (part): "Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give a reason for the hope that is in you. But do this with gentleness and respect." (Also Colossians 4:6.) We believe it is the duty of every Christian to understand the revealed word of God as best as they are able, to defend the church and themselves from the world and false teachers.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-bible"></span>
									<h3>Second Purpose</h3>
									<p>We exist to deepen the faith of the faithful. Ephesians 4:12-14: "...for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, ... so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ[.]" We believe that the more you understand Scripture, the more faithful you become, the more you recognize God's glory and beauty and your own depravity, and the closer to him you get.</p>

											<h2>What's with the name?</h2>
											<p>We draw the name from a Scriptural narrative, presented below, that God's words are sweeter than honey, that we have been lifted from the ashes of our sin - but that we are to mourn as sitting in ashes when we sin. It is to remember where we are going and from where we have come.<br/>
                                            (We also just like the way it sounds. Man's first task was to be a gardener, so if it reminds you of gardening all the better!)</p>

Daniel 9:3:<br/>
Then I turned my face to the Lord God, seeking him by prayer and pleas for mercy with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.<br/>
Jonah 3:6:<br/>
The word reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, removed his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.<br/>
1 Samuel 2:8:<br/>
He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and on them he has set the world.<br/>
1 Kings 13:5:<br/>
The altar also was torn down, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the Lord.<br/>
Ezekiel 3:2-3:<br/>
So I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat. And he said to me, “Son of man, feed your belly with this scroll that I give you and fill your stomach with it.” Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.<br/>
Psalm 119:103:<br/>
How sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!<br/>
Numbers 14:8:<br/>
If the Lord delights in us, he will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that flows with milk and honey.<br/>
Ezekiel 20:6:<br/>
On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands.</p>
