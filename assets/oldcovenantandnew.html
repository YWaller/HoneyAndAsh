<h1>THE OLD COVENANT AND THE NEW</h1>

<p>Time to change topics once again! I did in fact state one of my purposes was to check the internal consistency of the Biblical God. To that end, something I encounter a lot is that supposedly, God acts very differently in the New Testament versus the Old. Additionally, most Christians have no doubt heard some variation of, when declaring that Scripture says something is sinful, &quot;Oh yeah? So then why do you wear fabric with different materials? That's in your Bible too! See, you're picking and choosing!&quot; Now, trying to defend themselves, many Christians will at this point mumble some half-remembered defense about &quot;categories of law&quot; like ceremonial and moral, or perhaps lamely reply &quot;That was for the Israelites only,&quot; but they'll fail to produce a convincing argument or even explain why at all.  In this chapter, thus, I intend to explain the apparent discrepancies between what we see in the Old Testament and the New Testament requirements and law-wise. And no, it has nothing to do with three completely, one hundred percent made-up whole cloth &quot;categories&quot; of laws. This bothers me enough to say it at the outset: that argument is completely a-Scriptural! The law is never treated as anything but a whole entity in Scripture. Please do not use that argument! The real answer is fairly simple anyways, but because we're so used to thinking about this incorrectly, I have to go through it point by point.  To say it succinctly, in Scripture, we find over and over that God makes covenants with men. Sometimes with individuals, sometimes with whole people groups, sometimes with every single human being. The two most important of these are those that generally cover the two Testaments. In the Old Testament, men were under the Law of Moses (the Ten Commandments, and all the rest). However, in the New Testament, we are under the new covenant of Christ. If a law has a parallel in the new covenant, we are obligated to follow it. If not, then not. That's the deal.  I'm going to let Paul do the talking for me first. From Galatians 5: &quot;Look: I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you. I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that he is obligated to keep the whole law. You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace.&quot;</p>

<p> Galatians is essentially a righteous rant by Paul in defense of the gospel and the stupidity of trying to follow the law in light of the messianic hope. If you think, for one microsecond, when you correctly follow one of the Old Testament laws that it somehow contributes to your justification before the Lord, you have cosmically screwed up (so serious is this that Paul says he wishes the men advocating for circumcision would castrate themselves in Galatians), and as Paul further says, endangered your very relationship with Christ himself. So, tread carefully when thinking about the Law of Moses and its relationship to you. The first thing I want to discuss about the Law of Moses, or the Mosaic Law, is how it handled forgiveness of sins. In the Mosaic Law, God gave painstakingly detailed instructions on how to be forgiven for sins, and to avoid paying the price for them. This was done in part by way of animal sacrifice. The animals given up to God were offered in place of the real sinner, however, this sacrifice could only ever be temporary and incomplete; people had to offer these sacrifices up frequently.  When Jesus was killed, he became the ultimate, and final, sacrifice. Jesus can and does cover over any sin , fully and finally. The sacrifices of the Old Testament were not sufficient to fully solve the problem; all they did was cover over sin. In a word, they were reactive, not preventative. As in, these sacrifices never got at the root of the problem of sin. Think of it as if you have a rusty old water tank. Whenever it springs a new leak, you patch it. But it would be a better solution to instead replace the tank itself, yes? Explained another way, sacrificial offerings existed to cover the penalty of sin, yet sin dwelled in everyone in perpetuity. (Isaiah 1:11-20, though, reminds us that it is not and never was empty ritualism that covers sin.)  How many times have we all heard of the scene where Jesus turned water into wine? Let's examine that a little bit more closely for a second. First, the story opens by John telling us it was the third day of a wedding (neither thing is a coincidence; consider all the wedding metaphors in Scripture and also the third day). Second, there were six stone jars for Jewish purification rites. I hope I don't need to smack you over the head with this one, at least not fully. To the ancient Israelites, seven represented perfect completeness; six represented incompleteness. So immediately, a Jewish audience would be clued in here: how do we complete the picture? Christ is the seventh jar. Then, the jars were filled to the brim with water and he turned it into amazing wine. Going through John 2 is not the point of this section, but all that is to say, Christ was here showing us all that he offered a better washing than what was previously on offer through the old system. That is our starting point. John 1:29 tells us this: &quot;The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, 'Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!'&quot;</p>

<p>We see here that Jesus can fully remove sin from us, a large advantage. This is something the Law and Old Testament sacrifices could never do. Next, examine Hebrews 7:18&ndash;19: &quot;The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless (for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God.&quot;</p>

<p>These later verses in Hebrews 7 give us additional information: &quot;&#8230;but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood. Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. Such a high priest truly meets our need&mdash;one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens. Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself. For the law appoints as high priests men in all their weakness; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.&quot;</p>

<p>This highlights a very important component of Jesus' priesthood: he was perfect, and therefore his sacrifice could be perfect. This is contrasted with sinful human high priests who had to first make themselves clean time and time again through sacrifice. The strict requirements of an animal without blemish, and priests similarly without blemish, given in Leviticus and elsewhere were to ensure that these stand-ins were as perfect as could be found in our fallen creation, but they were never even close to being actually perfect (remember that even Moses was denied as being good enough). Again in Hebrews 8 we have the following, that paint the picture nicely: &quot;But in fact the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs [the Priests] as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, since the new covenant is established on better promises. For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another.&quot;</p>

<p>Here are selected parts of Hebrews 8 (Paul quoting Jeremiah) so that you can see the narrative: &quot;God found fault with the people and said: The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel&#8230;because they did not remain faithful to my covenant, and I turned away from them&#8230;I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, 'Know the Lord,' because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest. For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.&quot;</p>

<p>Hebrews 8 ends with: &quot;By calling this covenant &quot;new,&quot; he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear.&quot;</p>

<p>However, this is the question, why was the old one obsolete? We're now into Hebrews 9: &quot;Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary&#8230;In its first room were the lampstand and the table with its consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place&#8230;the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry. But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance. The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still functioning. This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper. They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings&mdash;external regulations applying until the time of the new order.&quot;</p>

<p>There's a lot to unpack here, in these sections from both Hebrews 8 and 9. God says that he is going to replace this system with something new. Our sin and wickedness will be forgiven and gone. Right away we see that this is an improvement over the old, in that it is not merely covering our sins, it's removing them. This is made more clear in Hebrews 9. Remember, the 'earthly sanctuary' that's being talked about was the tabernacle, which was a sort of portable temple for the Lord. The priests had to enter following a very specific set of rules, or else they would be quite literally killed by entering. Hebrews 9 informs us that this is all to demonstrate that man has no real way to get close to God. These 'external regulations' could not cleanse your soul of sin, as is needed to approach God and not be burned up. Here is Hebrews 7:18-19 once more: &quot;The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless (for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God.&quot;</p>

<p>Do you see where this is going? When we are washed with the blood of Jesus, it is not just the outside of the body that is cleansed. Your spirit is washed as well, and a process of renewal begins that persists until you are brought fully into the company of God at the end. See here in Exodus 40: &quot;Moses could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.&quot;</p>

<p>Moses himself could not go into the tent while guilty, without the proper cleansing that is given in Leviticus as a pattern for the new covenant. More in Hebrews 9: &quot;But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made with human hands, that is to say, is not a part of this creation. He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption. The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean.&quot;</p>

<p>There's that word, sanctify. You are made outwardly holy so that you may approach the Most Holy Place. Note the word eternal here (still in Hebrews 9): &quot;How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God! For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance&mdash;now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.&quot;</p>

<p>So that answers that. The Mosaic Law brought awareness to sin, and Christ brought salvation from it. From Colossians 2:13-14: &quot;And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross.&quot;</p>

<p>To repeat myself, the sacrifices of the Old Testament were not sufficient to fully solve the problem of sin; all they did was cover it over. Further, we were servants under the old covenant; but in the new, we are sons of God. What difference does that make? For starters, we are no longer under the ten commandments as laid out in the Old Testament. Hold on! Before you toss this work on the trash heap for heresy, allow me to explain with the headline: we are under their equivalents in the New Testament.  First, the Mosaic Law, as we saw in Hebrews, was in force until the New Covenant came to be. I want to make clear, immediately, that the Law is treated as a unit in both Testaments (said for those who say there are &quot;categories&quot; in the law). We are either under all of it or none of it; no provision is made in the New Testament for certain categories applying to us. So now I must argue fully for the position that the entirety of the Old Covenant has passed away, and to cling to part of it is to devalue the New Covenant.  Jesus Christ was the fulfillment of the Old Testament law (Romans 10:4): &quot;Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.&quot;</p>

<p>So, the Law was fulfilled, and Christians are not bound to it, since we are not ancient Israelites and have the New Covenant. There is no argument for keeping just part of it, as some people say. They go &quot;ah but the moral components of the law still apply!&quot; No they don't. Neither Jesus nor Paul nor anyone else with authority (of course Christ has more than the Apostles) says that any part of the law is in force on Christians. No one. &quot;What about Matthew 5:17-20?&quot; Comes next most often: &quot;Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.&quot;</p>

<p>Much has been made of this paragraph. But remember Romans 10:4 above. We know Christ fulfilled the whole law perfectly (1 Peter 2:22, John 8:46). So, in order to figure this out, we need to understand what Jesus did, and in what context he did it.  In Hebrews 9, we had a section that describes how Jesus finally performed that which the first covenant was a symbol of. Next, though, in Hebrews 10, we see something remarkable: &quot;Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: 'Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me; with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased. Then I said, 'Here I am&mdash;it is written about me in the scroll&mdash;I have come to do your will, my God.' ' First he said, 'Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them' -though they were offered in accordance with the law. Then he said, 'Here I am, I have come to do your will.' He sets aside the first to establish the second. And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.&quot;</p>

<p>See the culmination of this in Colossians 2:14: &quot;&#8230;having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross.&quot;</p>

<p>And see these verses here, Ephesians 2:15 and then Galatians 3:23-25: &quot;by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace,&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Before the coming of this faith, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed. So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith. Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.&quot;</p>

<p>If the law still had hold of us, it wouldn't have been fulfilled. If it still bound us, then Jesus' sacrifice was not enough. Why? See Galatians 2:16: &quot;know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified.&quot;</p>

<p>We are fully capable of being justified, made righteous, not just having our sins covered under a new covenant. And remember, the whole law was fulfilled. It is not a separable thing. But what does Scripture call this new covenant? Galatians 6:2: &quot;Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.&quot;</p>

<p>With the end of the Mosaic Law of the old covenant, Jesus established a new one, which was predicted by the prophets (among them Moses, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel). Now here is Jesus himself describing the new covenant in Luke 22:20: &quot;In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.&quot;</p>

<p>See Romans 6:14-18: &quot;For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace. What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? By no means! Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey&mdash;whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance. You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.&quot;</p>

<p>So what is the &quot;pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance?&quot; James 1:25: &quot;But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.&quot;</p>

<p>And James again uses this phrase in James 2:12: &quot;Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom,&quot;</p>

<p>Paul also calls it the 'law' in Romans 3:27: &quot;Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith.&quot;</p>

<p>So, what is this law of liberty, that gives freedom, that requires faith, not works (that is called the law of Christ)? How does it relate to the New Covenant? Galatians chapter 3 is in its entirety a wealth of information, but it specifically deals with the difference between the Old Covenant and the New; here are some select verses from it (I summarize afterwards): &quot;Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit [been saved by Christ], are you now being perfected by the flesh [the old covenant]? &#8230; Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith&mdash; just as Abraham &quot;believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness&quot;?  &quot;Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us&mdash;for it is written, &quot;Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree&quot;&mdash; so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith. &#8230; &quot;This is what I mean: the law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void. For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise. &#8230; Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made &#8230; Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law. But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. &quot;Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed. So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith.&quot;</p>

<p>1. Abraham's offspring (singular), Christ, blesses the faithful in order for us to receive the spirit. 2. The law had a purpose as an intermediary before the promise to Abraham was fully given. It would serve its function until the promise was brought to fruition. So, you see, that is the explanation for both Matthew 5:17-20, and the law of liberty. The law of liberty, or faith, separates us from the law God's people were held captive under. It does not destroy it or nullify it or make it obsolete, but we are simply removed from it and placed under the promise, which is the New Covenant. The law does not go away: we are just not beholden to it. They sound similar, but they are not. The law rules over the realm of the flesh, but we are in the spirit (Romans 8:9). The law of liberty releases us from the death sentence of the law, that brings condemnation and sin. We died to the (Mosaic) law, this is the lesson. We are dead to the law (Romans 7:4), and belong to Christ. We are released from the bonds of sin in order to live like Christ, and follow the 'summation' of the law in the two commands Jesus used to sum it up (Matthew 22:37-40): &quot;And he said to him, &quot;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.&quot;</p>

<p>Faith in God and love for all. Simpler, yet so much more demanding. Thankfully, we have the Holy Spirit to bring us closer to God and to more closely conform to this perfect image. Of course, Jesus took the time in his other sermons to get into specifics, but I won't re-iterate the whole New Testament. So to come back around to the initial bold claim I made, of the Ten Commandments, nine of them (sans the one concerning the sabbath) have an equivalent law under the New Covenant. Christ laid them out. He lists the second tablet in Mark 10, to the young rich man. Paul as well, in Romans 13:8-9, lists the first tablet (except the sabbath). You see, Jesus said none of the law went away; and they didn't. It has been transformed into the New Covenant. Also, with regards to the Sabbath, ironically enough (almost as if God knew what he was doing and covered all his bases, clearing up how we should treat the Sabbath, even) Paul says this in Romans 14:5: &quot;One person considers one day more sacred than another; another considers every day alike. Each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I'm still confused. What about wearing mixed fabric clothing and laws like that? Didn't Jesus say nothing will leave the law?&quot; I am the person asking that this time, and indeed even after reading the above, I asked that for a long time, and it took me a while to get the answer, but it's actually made plain by what I wrote above. Note that none of the individual commands of the Old Testament law apply to those under Christ. Not a one. Many have equivalents, but the original, even if worded exactly the same, is not over you.  Does that make sense? We aren't bound by the code of the Israel of the flesh, because we aren't part of that Israel. We're a new, spiritual Israel made up of believers from every nation. My problem, and perhaps your problem if you saw that final question about multi-colored fabric and didn't know how to answer it based on the Scripture above, is that by focusing on the fact that nothing will leave the law, you're missing where he said he fulfills it. The law will not change, but he fulfilled it. Read the Scripture I quote above. It all says Christ fulfilled the law, that we are no longer under it. No command of the Old Covenant has force over you, but many have equals in the New Covenant. I must sound like a broken record, but this is a huge misunderstanding in modern Christianity. Neither Christ nor the Apostles ever mention anything about multi-colored fabric, so we are good!  I hope that clears it up. It can be confusing. Follow Christ's example, be the servant of Christ, a Son (in the meaning of heir) of God, not of sin. He never rebuked anyone for what they wore, and he declared all food clean (Romans 14:20). Matthew 12:1-13 is a good example of interpreting the Law, when reading it for guidance as those unbound by it, through the lens of Christ. In this story, Christ's disciples ate heads of grain on the Sabbath; forbidden under the Old Covenant. In the Markian version of the story, Christ says: &quot;The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.&quot;</p>

<p>In response to accusations concerning the matter, Christ referenced the example of David in the Old Testament, who when he needed food, took special bread intended only for consumption by the priests; David had not been sinful, and neither were Christ's disciples being sinful. Christ then goes on to heal a man on the Sabbath, and he tells everyone that it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath. So, Christ was not against the Law, he was against the crushing burden the Pharisees had turned much of it into. Galatians 5:14: &quot;For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'&quot;</p>

<p>In sum, we see that at Christ's resurrection, the new covenant was now fully in place and the old fulfilled. After this, I used to have a section below that described the behavioral expectations under the Old Covenant and the New, but given that this work is the product of years of effort, I have matured in my understanding of Scripture from draft to draft, and I no longer see that view as accurate. What view? That God had different behavioral expectations for us under the Law. You see, as I argue elsewhere in this book, the way God saves a man from himself has never changed. It has always been by faith, either general or specific depending on when you live, but the core has been the same. In the removed text, I rather lengthily argued that under the Old Covenant, you were expected to tithe 10%, and now there was this expectation of generosity that could mean you should give a lot more than 10%, or less, depending on this or that.  I will grant, I made a good point: we don't have to tithe by command, 2 Corinthians 9: &quot; Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver&#8230; As it is written: 'They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor; their righteousness endures forever.'&quot;</p>

<p>And again I was right when I said &quot;If you're only giving out of a compulsion, then you aren't doing it for the right reasons; God is after our hearts, not compelled actions.&quot; But I was wrong when I implied God had ever desired nothing more than external adherence to his commands. If you look in the Old Testament, in the true men of God, you find generosity of the kind God has always been truly after. True, the substance is somewhat different from old to new, but so it is with specific versus general revelation. I imagine if Christ read my draft he would have words awfully similar to what he told Nicodemus for me, concerning this matter in particular.  Why am I saying all of this? Because God is consistent, despite his revelation being successional. I have stared these verses in the face all of my life, and never until the moment I was re-thinking this, had the true meaning of it all dawn on me. Matthew 22:36-40: &quot;'Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?' Jesus replied: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.'&quot;</p>

<p>How did Christ fulfill the law? Perfect obedience, yes, but moreover, perfect love. John 3:16: &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.&quot;</p>

<p>Again, as his revelation is successional, certain parts are different. Such is a time-bounded universe. But the God behind it, the meaning, the purpose, the intent behind it, has never wavered from sacrificial love for others. &quot;Did God ever mention this coming covenant in the Old Testament?&quot; How glad I am that you asked! Folks, if you haven't read the prophets with a keen eye, really, seriously, throw this book down and go do it. Isaiah 42:6, discussing The Servant:  &quot;I will give you as a covenant for the people,&quot;</p>

<p>Jeremiah 31:33: &quot;Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah,&quot;</p>

<p>So, rather easily, yes, it was mentioned.  Here, an atheist friend of mine, though somewhat versed in the Bible, asked: &quot;So God didn't give us the final system, the New Covenant in Old Testament times, 'because our hearts were hard', but since God is the one softening or hardening our hearts, why didn't he just soften our hearts to make it so we could accept the New Covenant's greater moral demands?&quot;   The first thing I'll do is quote from Judges 2:1-3: &quot;And he said, 'I brought you up from Egypt and brought you into the land that I swore to give to your fathers. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you, and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall break down their altars.' But you have not obeyed my voice. What is this you have done? So now I say, I will not drive them out before you, but they shall become thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.'&quot;</p>

<p>Partly because God is merciful to who he wishes to be (Romans 9:15), and being part of God's covenant is a privilege, a benefit. Being part of his household is not exactly cast as a reward, but it is the same sentiment: it's a bonus God gives when and where he chooses. Being good is to have some of God, and he chooses who he builds his temple with. See this from Isaiah 6:10-11, a pronouncement against the proud and haughty: &quot;Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.&quot;</p>

<p>Don't forget that we deserve to be our evil selves, never capable of godly joy. Thus, what is really being asked is &quot;Why didn't God give us more mercy than he already had?&quot; Because that was not his wish, and as an unearned gift, we cannot demand more. Put another way, being good is better and more enjoyable than being bad, thus being evil is its own punishment and the good of God is not guaranteed or owed to anyone who is not of his household.  So ends the specific example of generosity in comparing the differences between the expectations of the Old Covenant and the New. You see, the New Covenant is much stricter despite not being given to us in axiomatic form. Christ told us to be 'perfect', in order to fulfill it, and yet we cannot; we cannot attain sinless perfection, we won't reach that until we're with God (1 John 3:2): &quot;Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Woah okay, you lost me there,&quot; said someone. &quot;We were discussing the different in behavior between God in the Old Testament and the New at the outset of this chapter. I understand that you've explained the evolution of God's relationship with us as a way to make some of that go away, but I'm not convinced. It still seems like there's a big gap in behavior from him in the Old Testament and the New. Again, you showed us that yes, his relationship with us has changed by specific revelation, but that he always demanded the same things from us, but nothing else. In the Old Testament, God's love takes a backseat, and in the New Testament, his wrath takes a backseat. It's like he had a personality change.&quot;  Earlier in this book, I explained at some length how God's wrath is to our benefit, and often for our defense, so I don't feel the need to rehash that argument. I will thus advance with the notion that this discussion is not about whether God's wrath is justified, but why it seems he was more wrathful in the Old Testament than in the New.   The first point I will make is this. One, around 70 A.D., Jerusalem was&#8230; I don't even know what string of words to use to describe what Rome did to Jerusalem, imagine walking in your hometown after an army had levelled it, slaughtered its inhabitants. What words would you use? Jesus predicted this catastrophe, though, and declared it was a judgement of God. That's the first thing; God did not stop judging the nations or Israel. Second, God mocked, beat, tortured, crucified, and killed his own son. One could hardly call that an act lacking in wrath. Revelation 14 says this: &quot;If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also will drink the wine of God's wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.&quot;</p>

<p> Whether or not you accept my formerly stated hypothesis that much of Revelation concerns the events of 70 AD, you will regardless accept that this is from the New Testament, and it depicts no small measure of divine anger intended for the non-Old Testament time period. Finally, Christ the son of God himself gave us vivid depictions of Hell, more intense than those in the Old Testament, and gave grave warnings of it. Hell is the full measure of God's wrath, so this is also a point of consistency between the &quot;level of wrath&quot; displayed by him in both. So! I will quickly conclude that God's wrath is present in both the Old and New Testaments. (I surely do not need to remind you of the various incidents of his wrath depicted in the Old.)  What that leaves, though, is the presence of God's love in the Old Testament. Do we see it in equal measure? It is undoubtedly true that his greatest act of love for us was the sacrifice of his Son, but the body of this work has explained that God intended for that event to occur some time after our fall, so that's not particularly relevant. Certain parts of Scripture are intended to explain certain things about God. It is a teaching, revelatory work after all, so because one small section here or there depicts more wrath than love is hardly noteworthy. No, what's meant here is this: &quot;Did God's philosophy become more loving, more patient, in the New Testament?&quot;   One detractor in reading this far reached immediately for the welcoming of foreigners in the New Testament, but I pointed them to the abundant protections given foreigners among the Israelites in the Old. Further, verses like Genesis 22:18 show us that God always had an eye for all mankind though the Jews were chosen for the Messiah's bloodline:  &quot;and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.&quot;</p>

<p> I don't feel a need to re-display God's patience with us in the Old Testament, this was done in detail by examples in Ezekiel earlier in this work. Second, implicitly, so, where is his love then? I'll remind you of the Scriptural definition of love, found in 1 Corinthians 13:4-8: &quot;Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way ; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things .&quot;</p>

<p> As I've said before, if you offer up another definition of love, I will shrug my shoulders and tell you to argue with someone who uses that definition of love. Now let's see God's love in the Old Testament. I'll be cheeky and start with the fact that there even is an Old Testament, given that as I have said many times, we should all be whooshed into Hell right this very moment before we finish blinking, but he wants us to repent, so he forestalls his justice. Mercy is an act of love. However, I can be more specific, and so I shall. I've talked a great deal about the Exodus in this work, so I will only remind you that it occurred, and that it was a great, real, physical demonstration of God's love as he fought for and defended the Israelites from the Egyptians to bring them out of slavery.   Jonah 2:2, when Jonah was inside the belly of the great fish:  &quot;In my distress I called to the LORD, and He answered me. From the depths of the grave I called for help, and you listened to my cry.&quot;</p>

<p> Jonah 3:10, after the people and king of Nineveh repented and relented and asked God for mercy:  &quot;When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, He had compassion and did not bring upon them the destruction he had threatened.&quot;</p>

<p> I have chosen Jonah first particularly because Christ references Jonah. I think something often forgotten when going through Jonah, is that the whole time Jonah is running from God, and God is being abundantly patient with Jonah&#8230; he's also being abundantly patient with Nineveh. He wants to show them the truth, he wants them to repent, and he teaches Jonah something at the same time. Next I'll go to the book of Judges, which details the history of some of Israel's worst leaders. I mean these guys were just not good: violent, arrogant, foolish, promiscuous&#8230; take your pick, really. But God always delivered his people from their idiocy and flagrant disobedience. See a bit from Judges 2: &quot;Then the Lord raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them. Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they whored after other gods and bowed down to them. They soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked, who had obeyed the commandments of the Lord, and they did not do so. Whenever the Lord raised up judges for them, the Lord was with the judge, and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. For the Lord was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who afflicted and oppressed them.&quot;</p>

<p> God always pursued Israel. He always had prophets guiding her, men at arms to defend her, until it simply became too much. He sought after her all day. Isaiah 65 is a chapter full of God's love, here are some verses from it:  &quot;I was ready to be sought by those who did not ask for me; I was ready to be found by those who did not seek me. I said, 'Here I am, here I am,'&quot;</p>

<p> In the latter parts of the chapter, verses 17-25, God promises a new heaven and a new earth to those who return his love, that will be peace and light and joy. He promises an image of the same to those who serve him in this life, too, in verses 13-16. These promises are from his love, and bear an exactness of resemblance to those we find in the New Testament.  Frankly, I think those who say &quot;God's character changes from the Old Testament to the New Testament,&quot; have never bothered to read much of either, or if they have, they have not actually comprehended the text in anything but passing detail&#8230; I am reminded of a poem:</p>

<p>I met a seer. He held in his hands The book of wisdom. &quot;Sir,&quot; I addressed him, &quot;Let me read.&quot; &quot;Child-&quot; he began. &quot;Sir,&quot; I said, &quot;Think not that I am a child, For already I know much Of that which you hold. Aye, much.&quot; He smiled. Then he opened the book And held it before me.- Strange that I should have grown so suddenly blind. Stephen Crane, The Black Riders and other Lines, XXXVI</p>

<p>As I said, certain passages magnify certain aspects of God's character. But he is always there in fullness, as these examples and many others I could offer demonstrate of his love and dutiful attention to those he loves in the Old Testament. But before I close this chapter, let's end with a bit of a dialogue of sorts that's the distilled essence of questions I get right about now when I bring this up in debates: &quot;But God is saving us from himself, no? Seems ridiculous to call that love or mercy. Here let me tell you deserve a beating and then tell you 'I'll let you off this time'; what a manipulative bully your God is.&quot; Ironically enough, an atheist friend of mine gave me part of my response here; he said, paraphrasing, &quot;All relationships are conditional, that's what makes it a relationship. You don't get to just take take take from someone forever or dictate top down all the time.&quot; All love is mutual, conditional. Imagine a human relationship where one spouse got to do whatever, whenever, even though the other hated some of those things; that is not a healthy relationship. So that's part of it.  We have a relationship with the Christian God; all of us, every individual, because we live in his creation. God wants it to be a loving relationship according to his divine (i.e. better than mortal) definition of love; from how much he pursues us and that definition above, and what he promises and has given us (the garden, heaven, not to mention a personal relationship with God, the guy who makes stars) I'd hardly call that manipulative. He promises us purpose, a family, joy, a home. Everything. &quot;But where exactly do we get to put our wants and desires into this? You said all love is two-way, so where's our way?&quot; This is where him being God and the 'Father' in the sense of head of household colors the relationship. A romantic human relationship really isn't a facsimile for the God-human one. For one, he's God so he demonstrably knows better than us what's good for us. Two, he does listen to us, through prayer and the like.  &quot;But he threatens us with hell, and forces us to follow his commands to get those rewards. You're ignoring all of that. What if I don't want those rewards from him? This still sounds manipulative and like bullying.&quot; He is the head of household, the owner of us all, and he sets the rules and the punishment for breaking them. I discussed that at length in the chapter on evil and sin; I won't rehash it. Also, forces us? Then hell would be empty. Second, Christ's gift of salvation is freely given from his love, and predicated upon faith, not following commands perfectly; legalism and trying to follow them perfectly is a death sentence, so this statement is incorrect at the outset. Yes, you're expected to hate your evil and work to get rid of it, but&#8230; ok? Got me there.  If you have some behaviors you hold so dear that you think hell is worth keeping them, that you disagree Christ needed to die for&#8230; then so be it, but you can't say God didn't made it pretty hard to go there. Again I have been over this in the chapter on evil and sin, but God cares about us, and he knows anything that isn't his goodness is harmful to us. (I am reiterating this and not only pointing you to previous chapters is because the focus here is on how God is loving in this, not simply justified; the justification was handled in previous chapters.) &quot;It sounds in these responses like you're implying God has some personal right to toss us in hell for failing to keep up our end of a relationship. Like our sin harms God in some way. How does it? How does he have a right to toss me in hell when I have not and cannot hurt him?&quot; Creation is his, yes? He made it, it's his. Imagine if you had just built a sand castle on the beach that you loved, it was your pride and joy. Now, some other kid walks up and starts stomping on it; you have the right to prevent that. Or imagine it's your child someone is harming.  We don't hurt God, we hurt ourselves and creation. This is more evidence that God cares for us, since while not personally harmed, he is personally invested. This one is kind of asking, &quot;Why would you care if I walked in your house covered in vomit? Sat on your couch?&quot; If you died right now in your sin, the universe would clap and celebrate being rid of your evil. God doesn't want you to be infested by sin, and he won't let you kick over his sand castle or harm his children endlessly.  If you disagree that you're infested by sin, covered in vomit, he has every right to toss you out of his house. But he says &quot;you're covered in vomit, here come in and take a shower,&quot; and all you have to do is&#8230; believe you're covered in vomit and need his shower to get clean. That's love, but love is a two way street. I rather find it the person asking these questions to be the manipulative one, frankly, framed as a statement to God a bit excessively to make my point: &quot;Sure you offer me all of that , and you don't want me to hurt myself or others, but you know what? I don't care. I'm going to ignore everything you say, call you an idiot and a liar for saying my actions are bad, come in your house covered in vomit and sit on your furniture, and then I'll be upset, mad, and call you evil when you toss me out after I refuse to take a shower and get clean.&quot; Right, God's the one being an unloving, manipulative bully here. Here is an excerpt from Micah 6 on this issue: &quot;for the Lord has an indictment against his people, and he will contend with Israel. 'O my people, what have I done to you? How have I wearied you? Answer me! For I brought you up from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery,' &#8230; 'With what shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before God on high? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?' He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?&quot;</p>

<p> God tells us that he has done much for us, and there's nothing we can offer in return as a gift he wants; not even the ultimate gift we can offer, a child. (Verses left out mention ten thousand rivers of oil, that sort of thing, as well.) He tells us what he wants from us, and it's really not much, and it's really not bad for us. And Micah 7: &quot;Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity and passing over transgression for the remnant of his inheritance? He does not retain his anger forever, because he delights in steadfast love. He will again have compassion on us; he will tread our iniquities underfoot. You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea. You will show faithfulness to Jacob and steadfast love to Abraham, as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.&quot;</p>

<p>I digress, though. That wraps up this two-chapter narrative of the nature of the Christian God's relationship with a fallen creation. Up next is a slight shift in topic, to the defense of the single most important thing in Scripture: the life, death, and resurrection of Christ.</p>
