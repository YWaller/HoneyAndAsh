<h2>Special Article A - Daniel's Lesser Prophecies</h2> <p> The Book of Daniel contains the amazing prophecy concerning Christ's death that is described in the main work, but it also contains another grand prophecy that is worth discussing. You know, it's ironic: ever since AD 200 or thereabouts, doubters have been saying that Daniel must have been written after the fact, long after Alexander the Great's time; there can be no way, they say, that a man could know what was going to happen with such accuracy. Indeed. But I'm getting ahead of myself, what is the other prophecy? There are a couple prophecies in Daniel that aren't the big one, such as in Daniel 2 where Daniel predicts four successive, powerful empires; of course, we know these as the present (to Daniel) Babylonian empire, then the Medo-Persians, then the Greeks, and finally the Roman empire. Then there's the one in Daniel 8, whereby Daniel relates what would happen with Alexander the Great. Daniel 8:8 talks about his untimely death, and his replacement by four new kingdoms who wouldn't have his power: we know of course that this is exactly what happened. So, this was around 250 years before Alexander; pretty impressive, no? I heard a scholar of some repute talk about Daniel, and he summed it up with (lightly paraphrased, it has been a number of years): &quot;Of course, the main way we know that Daniel was written after the fact is the simple truth that men do not have visions of the future.&quot; If you fall into that camp, I have nothing for you, but for you to remember Daniel's prophetic prediction of the very month Jesus would die and its indisputability and its accuracy, and give that a good, hard think. However, if you are of a not-so-closed minded nature, and find a man telling the future with such exacting detail to not be a problem with sufficient defense, then let's go on. Below I go through the main arguments I've heard against Daniel as a whole.  Many issues concerning Daniel have been resolved by archeology; one claim is that Daniel's three years of training before entering the king's service, and Daniel 2's claim that it was set during the 'second year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign', was impossible. However, with the discovery of the Nabonidus Chronicle and the Gezer Calendar, we know now that there is no issue of years. The Chronicle is an inscription by a king who lived around 553&ndash;539, and the Gezer Calendar is dated to king Rehoboam (922&ndash;905). These detail, together, that a king took his first full year as his accession year, and started the count for his own reign as the beginning of the next. To make a long and boring story of calendars short, Daniel 1:1 claims that Nebuchadnezzar took Jerusalem in the &quot;third year of the reign of Jehoiakim&quot;: roughly 606 to 605 (see Jeremiah 46:2, there's a story here about the Nisan calendar and all that). Nebuchadnezzar succeeded his father in 605, so his accession year was from 605 to 604, his first year 604 to 603, and his second, therefore, would be 603 to 602. Daniel was captured when the siege was undertaken, and ended in 602. Fancy how that lines up, huh? Fancy how Daniel somehow had an intricate understanding of Babylonian court records, and yet he was supposedly a Hebrew writing some 400 years after the fact, indeed! It is often claimed that the Prayer of Nabonidus, a much older story, was turned into Nebuchadnezzar's story in Daniel 4. There were three supposed similarities, one of which was discovered to be an outright falsehood (the 7 years Nabonidus spent disturbed was actually 10, and Nabonidus had a skin condition, not madness.) Thus only literary connections between these two stories are common things: it's like if one story said &quot;and they lived happily forever after,&quot; and so did another, and someone went &quot;see look it's plagiarism!&quot; In a word, this is nonsense. Being afflicted by God is a staple of ancient literature, and a foreigner magician being there is only a 'similarity' in the same way that Gandalf and Ben Kenobi were both old warriors of the light who died fighting an evil black thing while the hero watched. You have to squint awfully hard to make it work. Hard enough to call it &quot;disingenuous.&quot; Fourth, did Darius the Mede exist? This was a thorn in the side of Prophetic Daniel believers for quite some time: there was no evidence of him. However, much like atheists once claimed that Sargon the Great's kingdom didn't exist as a way to invalidate the Bible, and then we found the bloody capital city out in the desert&#8230; all it took was time. A writer named Steven Anderson used Xenophon's Cyropaedia, a biography of Cyrus the Great, to argue that Cyrus shared power with a Mede called Cyaxares II. To summarize, Cyaxares II became, after the fall of Babylon, the king of the Medo-Persian empire, and Cyrus was subordinate to him. Next, we have the Babyloniaca, written by a priest named Berossus, who directly references &quot;Darius the king&quot; in companion with Cyrus. We come to the question, then: who could this Darius be? Well, given Xenophon's account&#8230; we have but one person. Cyaxares II. Since he was the King of Media, one finds it to be a very small leap to see him called &quot;Darius the Mede.&quot; Josephus also says this: &quot;Now Darius put an end to the dominion of the Babylonians with Cyrus his relative&#8230; who was the son of Astyages&#8230;&quot; Xenophon identified that son as as Cyaxares II. It's inescapable that Darius the Mede was real. A Greek named Harpocration also tells us there were two Dariuses, not just Darius the Great: he tells us that a coin called the Daric was not named for the father of Xerxes (Darius the Great), but a &quot;certain other more ancient king.&quot; What about Belshazzar and Nebuchadnezzar? Ah this one is my favorite, actually. Scholars swore up, down, and sideways that Belshazzar straight up didn't exist until fairly recently, until the discovery of the Haran steles. These confirmed that he existed and was king. I just like reminding atheist scholars of this, that &quot;the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence.&quot; But more to the point, scholars decry Daniel being the 'third highest ruler' (Daniel 5:29). How could this be? It doesn't make sense they say: unfortunately, Daniel should have been the second highest ruler in the kingdom, if Belshazzar was king! But, those pesky Haran steles tell us that Nabonidus was king in absentia, and thus first, making Belshazzar second, and Daniel&#8230; third. Honestly, this is grand evidence for Daniel, as unless someone who was making this up knew these precise details, they would have also said Daniel was second, like everyone assumed he should have been, until we got those steles. There's a great deal of discussion to be had about the language in Daniel, but really, if you're at the point where you're going &quot;nuh uh they didn't have those loan words in their language at that year,&quot; you're&#8230; reaching. We can hardly tell when loan words enter language in modernity, let alone in the 500s BC.  Did Daniel even exist? And here we come to it. What about the supposed author himself, Daniel? Who was he? It's claimed he's not mentioned until 140 BC, unless of course you count the book of Ezekiel which names him directly, three times (14:14,20, and 28:3). Those who argue this Daniel is not that Daniel fail to recognize the similarity between Job, Noah, and Daniel as cited in the first two verses; their trust in God, despite residing in foreign lands, they were saved by their righteousness (mentioned by Ezekiel himself in 14:20)&#8230; and so on. Also, when detractors try to claim that this Daniel is actually 'Dn'il', an Ugaritic folk legend, they fail to recognize that Dn'il was a Baal worshipper, who Ezekiel would not have said was saved by his righteousness. Given that Ezekiel was writing in the 570s, one can rather easily say that Daniel had become famous in the intervening 30 year period and so he was freshly upon Ezekiel's mind. As there is no other Daniel who fits this pattern, and it makes enormous sense for Ezekiel to be referencing a Daniel who had become famous and important a mere thirty years prior&#8230; one can only reasonably conclude that he is speaking of that Daniel. And so we come to the end. Daniel knew far too much about the sixth century to not have been from it; he described the city of Susa accurately (8:2). This includes the discovery at Ur by the archeologist Leonard Woolley, which confirms the gold statue and rites described towards the beginning of Daniel 3, as a marked departure from the typical religious practices of that time and place - something you really couldn't know occurred hundreds of years after the fact. But I digress, he just can't have gotten it all so very right before it happened, because that would imply he really was a prophet, and well, we just can't have that in our world where men can't tell the future with God's help, can we? Oh, lastly, about one of Daniels' prophecies, a common argument is that Daniel 11:40&ndash;45 didn't happen in the time of Antiochus IV Epiphanes. This would be bad, if there were not a paragraph differentiation between Daniel 11:35 and Daniel 11:36. Daniel 35 even says &quot;until the time of the end, for it will still come at the appointed time&quot; - which hints to the reader that what comes next is going to be about. No one doubts that Antiochus IV is the king in Daniel 11:28, but I do want the people who make this claim to reconcile Antiochus IV being the King of the North with this, Daniel 11:40: &quot;At the time of the end the king of the South will engage him in battle, and the king of the North will storm out against him with chariots and cavalry and a great fleet of ships. He will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>Notice anything&#8230; odd? Perhaps that the King of the North is supposed to be ranging against Antiochus IV, but wait, Antiochus IV is the King of the North, right? Wrong, at least in this section. It's fairly well obvious that it's two different time periods given these two pieces of information. But that's the end of that.</p>

<h2>Special Article B - the Book of Enoch</h2> <p> The book of Enoch is probably the single book of the apocrypha that demands being thoroughly dismantled. If you're coming here from the chapter on &quot;how we got the bible,&quot; I gave a few criteria for how you can easily dismiss many of the apocrypha for the New Testament. But I feel that I should do one in detail, and so I have chosen the Book of Enoch. I also hear it talked about a lot more than most of the others, so it doubly suits my purpose. The first main problem with the book of Enoch is that there are zero manuscripts of it from the time it was supposedly written, or indeed before the 2nd century BC. I'll go through some info about it and then towards the bottom describe some doctrinal issues it presents, as it says things which go against the rest of Scripture. But first, some say that Jude 14&ndash;15 quotes Enoch, so let's see if that's the case. Here's 1 Enoch 1:9: &quot;And behold! He cometh with ten thousands of His holy ones to execute judgment upon all, and to destroy all the ungodly: and to convict all flesh of all the works of their ungodliness which they have ungodly committed, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.&quot; And then Jude 1:14-15: &quot;Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men also, saying, 'Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgment on all, to convict all who are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.'&quot;</p>

<p>This appears at first glance to be fairly convincing, yes? Three problems. One, plenty of texts are quoted in the Bible that are not canonical in their totality, such as the references to the Book of Jasher recorded in Joshua 10:13 and 2 Samuel 1:18; their inclusion means that the part referenced and quoted is Scripture, but the rest of the work is not. So the mere quotation of a work does not, in and of itself, make a whole work Scripture. As for the second reason, the word used in Jude, that 'prophesied' there, is proph&eacute;teu&oacute;. Its cognate, prophetes, was used in Titus 1:12 to refer to a heathen poet, and the word itself is only used as a citation once in Matthew 15:7 to cite Isaiah 29. Indeed, in that same section of Titus, Paul asserts that the pagan he is quoting is correct, even; yet this does not mean the poet's words in total bear inclusion as Scripture. Third, it is entirely possible that Jude is referring to a real prophecy by Enoch&#8230; that is not from this book of Enoch. Oral traditions are powerful, and considering the care with which the Jews recorded information, it is plausible it survived. Notice the curious differences between the two. The book of Enoch says that the righteous were destroyed whereas Jude says they were judged. I don't know of any New Testament citation of Scripture that misquotes its source material. Also, Jude is careful to say that Enoch prophesied; it does not say that it quotes from the book of Enoch. Given those bits of information, there is no evidence that Jude is referring to the work as inspired. But let's continue. At best, assuming it was written pre-Jude, the Book of Enoch is inter-testamental, meaning it was written down between the conclusion of the Old Testament and the beginning of the New Testament, and therefore could not be an inspired work. Note that there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that Noah's great-grandfather Enoch actually wrote this, or that it was passed down to be written inter-testamental as oral tradition. Absolutely none, especially considering the Jews stopped only orally transmitting things as important as prophetic words literally thousands of years before. Likewise, they never included it in their canon. Some argue that certain Aramaic sections of the fragments we have for the book of Enoch 'seem' quite old, but something 'seeming' a certain way isn't even good enough for a traffic ticket, so it certainly isn't a standard I will use here. I will quote a scholar on it here as well: &quot;This pseudepigraph has evoked divergent opinions; but today there is a consensus that the book is a composite, portions of which are clearly pre-Christian as demonstrated by the discovery of Aramaic and Hebrew fragments from four of the five sections of the book among the Dead Sea Scrolls. One of these fragments, moreover, was copied in the second half of the second century B.C. The main question concerns the date of the second section, chapters 37-71, which contains the Son of Man sayings. J. T. Milik (esp. no. 755) has shown that this section, which is not represented among the early fragments, is probably a later addition to 1 Enoch; but his contention that it was composed around A.D. 270 (no. 755, p. 377) is very speculative. If, as most specialists concur, the early portions of 1 Enoch date from the first half of the second century B.C., chapters 37-71 could have been added in the first century B.C. or first century A.D. The original language of 1 Enoch appears to be Aramaic, except for the Noah traditions, which were probably composed in Hebrew.&quot; (The Pseudepigrapha and Modern Research, p. 98) That about sums it up. The Book of Enoch has multiple authors, is from multiple time periods, and is of dubious at best provenance (and providence). It was certainly not written by Enoch, and often, when a book claims some well-known and ancient personage as its author in order to lend itself legitimacy&#8230; one finds that it is the precise opposite of legitimate. Also, just go read the thing and it will become immediately apparent why it is not worthy of inclusion. Here's an overview of Enoch. (Introduction to the Intertestamental Period, pp. 142-143): &quot;The book was arranged by its last editor in five sections, as in the Psalms and other Jewish Books. Section I (1-36) is mainly concerned with pronouncing God's judgment by Enoch on the angels, or watchers who fell through their love for the daughters of men (Gen. 6:1-4), and Enoch's intercession for them. A weird description of Hades is found in this portion of 1 Enoch. Section II (37-71) has three 'parables,' or apocalyptic revelations, together with the story of Enoch's translation into heaven. Section III (72-87) is primarily concerned with furnishing a treatise on astronomy, the secrets of the movement of the stars as revealed to Enoch, who sees with his own eyes their very course, even the portals through which they enter and issue forth, for the purpose of transmitting the information to future generations. Section IV runs along lines laid down in the first two portions dealing with the problem of sin and suffering of Israel. Enoch relates to Methuselah his visions of the deluge, the fall of the angels, and their punishment in the underworld, the deliverance of Noah, the Exodus, the giving of the Law, the conquest of Canaan, the time of the judges, the establishment of the united kingdom, the building of the temple, the story of the two kingdoms, the fall of the Northern Kingdom, and the Exile. This is followed by four periods of angelic rule up to the time of the Maccabean Revolt, the last assault of the Gentiles, and the great Judgment. The last part of Section IV contains the prediction of the foundation of the new Jerusalem, the conversion of the Gentiles, the resurrection of the righteous, and the coming of the Messiah. Section V is without any account of the origin of sin but seems to be mainly devoted to the problem of suffering of the righteous and the prosperity of the oppressing sinners. It denounces evil and utters woes on sinners and promises blessings to the righteous. Within Section V is an older work 'The Apocalypse of Weeks' (93:1-10; 91:12-19). It concludes (105): 'In those days the Lord bade to summon and testify to the children of the earth concerning their wisdom: show (it) unto them; for ye are their guides, and a recompense over the world. For I and My Son will be united with them forever in the paths of uprightness and in their lives; and ye shall have peace; rejoice, ye children of uprightness. Amen.'&quot; (End of the quote from Introduction to the Intertestamental Period, pp. 142-143.) As you can see, the book offers 'visions' of history with great accuracy; considering my own work detailing the prophecies in Daniel, I know the Bible is capable of such, but the book overdoes it. If it were truly of Enoch, if it were truly that old, a New Testament author would have quoted such a monumental prophecy, or like how Ezekiel quoted the famous Daniel, Enoch's prophecies would have been quoted. Seriously, it presents an exact roadmap of Israel's history; they would've referred to it as &quot;it's ok, see God foresaw this and he's got it.&quot; This is what fake, after the fact prophecy looks like.  There is also the issue of the periods of Angelic Rule listed there (68-71, and elsewhere), which does not mesh with the history laid out in the rest of the Old Testament. We're told one time that an angel guards Israel, so the relevant important acts of angels are reliably reported in the Old Testament. Never are periods of angelic rule mentioned. And now on to some of the things it says which are not Scriptural: 1. 'Verse' 10:15 on to about chapter 11 details that after the deluge, righteousness would be restored and evil would be eliminated. This contradicts the Old Testament, it contradicts the New Testament&#8230; really everything. 2. Enoch 2:2-3 contradicts 2 Pet 3:3-7; it says that things have been going on in the same way since the beginning of creation, which is literally an argument 2 Peter warns about. 3. 10:8 places the blame for all the fallen angels on some angel named Azazel, which is not Scriptural. 4. Chapter 20 incorrectly assigns the roles of both Gabriel and Michael. 5. 41 calls the Kingdom of God divided. This contradicts Jesus and the rest of Scripture. 6. 47:4 says God requires the blood of the righteous, which is purely wrong. It isn't discussing the blood of the righteous one, mind, but all righteous, an offering of a 'number' of them. 7. In general, Enoch details, well, Enoch going down to Earth after being taken up by God, and that's not supported by the rest of Scripture. It's not precisely rejected, but no one else that God took made a habit of coming back. Seriously just go read it for yourself. It's very odd, and not in an Ezekiel kind of way: Ezekiel is odd because he's describing with words things neither he nor we understand. It's like a blind man trying to describe color. Enoch is odd for the same reason some of the gnostic works talking about Jesus are odd; it tries too hard to mimic that which it is not.  I hear frequently that the Early Church Fathers supported Enoch. The list is always very impressive; they cite Tertullian and Origen most often. Tertullian was a fan, calling it Scripture in Book 1, Chapter 3 of On the Apparel of Women. However, we must take care to remember that the Early Church Fathers are not the authority on what is Scripture, while their argument is supportive, they were fallible. Tertullian fell, in his later life, to Montanism, a heretical branch of Christianity, and On the Apparel of Women was most likely written after this fall; so one should treat the words within with great suspicion. So what about Origen? Origen cites it in the same breath as the Psalms (although he mis-translates the Psalm he's quoting) in De Principiis IV. However, the passages from Enoch he cites do not appear in the version we have. Origen mentions the Book of Enoch another time, in Contra Celsus, LIV. He doesn't quote it there, however, nor does he call it Scripture. It would appear that he considered it a useful book, but there is no evidence that he thought it was Scripture. Especially when you consider what I am about to relate. Be very careful when reading articles claiming what the Early Church Fathers did or did not say. I all too often see people butcher their quotes, cut out entire blocks of text, or outright lie about the content of their works or what they support. I found at least three different articles about Origen on Enoch that completely lied about the contents of De Principiis or Contra Celsus in an effort to support Enoch. If someone does not give you at the very least the book and chapter to go find it yourself, assume their quotation is a lie. For instance, I read several times people &quot;quoting&quot; De Principiis 3:3, saying that it supported the Book of Enoch as Scripture. Do you know what Origen was doing in that section? He was discussing heretics who said God created the Holy Spirit, and that it did not exist eternally as God. But because he said the word &quot;Scripture&quot; within the same paragraph as &quot;book of Enoch,&quot; he must therefore be discussing it as Scripture, right? No. Absolute nonsense. The paragraph, if anything, supports the notion that Origen separated Enoch from Scripture. See here: &quot;And in the book of Enoch also we have similar descriptions. But up to the present time we have been able to find no statement in holy Scripture in which the Holy Spirit could be said to be made or created&#8230;&quot; You tell me. Is Origen supporting Enoch as Scripture? No. He's intentionally separating it. He puts Enoch closer to something written by Hermas than Scripture (which was recognized even as early as the Muratorian Fragment, mentioned earlier, as non-Scriptural). The Muratorian Canon refutation is noted in Bart Ehrman, Lost Scriptures (Oxford University Press, 2003) page 333.</p>

<h2>Special Article C - The Tribe of Christ</h2> <p> Is the narrative of Christ consistent throughout the Bible? I have claimed that God knew about Jesus from the beginning; if that was true, one would expect him to show up throughout the Old Testament as well. As I've said a few times about various topics, there have been entire books written about the subject, but I want to laser in on one specific example, Christ's tribe. Turning to Matthew, we see in verse 3 of chapter 1 that of Jacob's children, he comes from Judah, and later on, from the line of King David. (And while I generally prefer Luke, Matthew has the more legible genealogy, but the same information is conveyed in Luke 3:33.) Here in Hebrews 7:14 we see this stated directly: &quot;For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah,&quot;</p>

<p>So let us see if we can find any foretelling of Christ in Judah himself. I believe we find it in Genesis chapter 44. This is in the midst of the story of Joseph, the son of Jacob (Jacob was more importantly known as Israel, bear that in mind as we wonder why Jesus came from Judah, Israel's son), who was betrayed by his brothers. We are at the scene where Joseph has decided to put the silver cup in the sack of the youngest of the brothers (Genesis 44:2). He then ensures that this brother, Benjamin, is caught with the silver cup. The brothers plead for mercy, contending their innocence, but Joseph tells them that only the &quot;guilty&quot; brother will become his slave. So Joseph is preparing to take Benjamin as his slave, and the brothers are undoubtedly anxious to prevent it. But, then, this happens - this is the really, really important bit: Judah, another of Jacob/Israel's sons, goes up to Joseph, and tells him that his father said of Benjamin, &quot;If &#8230; harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs in evil to Sheol.'&quot; So he's telling Joseph that if this youngest brother dies, their father will die as well. So Judah delivers this all-important line. Remember, all of the brothers are there, only Judah does this. Let's see what Judah says: &quot;Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the boy as a servant to my lord, and let the boy go back with his brothers.&quot; Look at that. Judah, the son of Israel, offers himself in the place of another as a sacrifice, to bear their guilt for having taken the cup. It's beautiful, it's a perfect comparison. We now have a man from the line of Judah, likewise a son of Israel the nation, who also takes the cup - but this time, it is the cup of God's wrath. And he bears the punishment for taking this cup in our stead. I really cannot hammer this home hard enough: look at it. It's perfect down to the cup! Perhaps I find this to be more incredible than it is, that Judah typified the sacrifice Christ would make so perfectly, but it's literally perfect down to a real cup standing in for the metaphorical cup of wrath. The imagery of Christ brought to life in this scene between Joseph and his brothers is incredible. Judah decides to sacrifice himself so that Israel may not die, bearing the weight of the punishment for the cup of wrath. Of the twelve brothers, who was it that was willing to pay the price for another? Judah. And that is why Christ comes from the line of Judah, son of Israel. See the blessing that Jacob gave Judah on his deathbed (Genesis 49:10&ndash;11): The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until he to whom it belongs shall come and the obedience of the nations shall be his. He will tether his donkey to a vine, his colt to the choicest branch; he will wash his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes.&quot;</p>

<p>And that eventually came to be Christ. There are many other areas in the Old Testament that point to Christ, but I find the Judah example to be particularly compelling.</p>

<h2>Special Article D - Inferior Legal Codes of Israel's Neighbors and Slavery in the Law and New Testament</h2> <p> Let's take a glance at some of the moral codes given to neighbor kingdoms of the Jews. They are the code of Ur-Nammi, the Middle Assyrian Legal Code, and the much more famous Code of Hammurabi (among others). The Code of Hammurabi is up first. When you examine the penalties therein, you will find many harsh and brutal punishments. Both the Law of Moses and the CoH record the death penalty for adultery and kidnapping, but they diverge in many crucial areas. One will find, observing both, that: 1. The CoH shows a blatant disregard for the value of human life, and makes no provisions to care for slaves or ensure they are treated well. The code of Ur-Nammi says you should return slaves if you find they've run away, but at least you have to pay the guy who caught them! How nice. 2. There are no provisions for forgiveness in the CoH, unlike the Mosaic Law. 3. There are no protections for the poor in the CoH. The Code of Ur-Nammi suffers similarly to the Code of Hammurabi, yet it somehow manages to be more sexist, with commands like: If a man proceeded by force, and deflowered the virgin female slave of another man, that man must pay five shekels of silver. The code of Ur-Nammi includes no protections for widows or those who men divorce (beyond a paltry sum of silver). Contrast this with God's very, very stern warning about their mistreatment in Exodus 22:21-23: &quot;You shall not ill-treat any widow or orphan. If you do mistreat them, I will heed their cry as soon as they cry out to Me, and My anger shall blaze forth and I will put you to the sword, and your own wives shall become widows and your children orphans.&quot;</p>

<p>I don't think I need to continue. Ur-Nammi details using acid to burn the mouths of slaves who back-talk. It uses the word &quot;shall.&quot; Not 'may,' shall. You must burn the mouth of a slave with salt acid. Ur-Nammi says that if you get caught bearing false witness, oops! Pay a fine of some silver. Wonderful protection against lying and false accusations there. The Middle Assyrian Legal Code, though, truly goes above and beyond in its awful treatment of slaves. Note A4: If a slave or slave-girl has received anything from a married woman, the slave(-girl)'s nose and ears are to be cut off, so that the theft will be avenged and the man shall cut off his wife's ears. But, if the man lets his wife off, and has not cut off her ears, the slave(girl) is not to lose nose or ears and the theft will not be avenged. So if you steal something and try to hide it by (no doubt) forcing your slave to take it, that slave is to be mutilated. They really love cutting off ears and noses, it's in a lot of their commands. They also love brutalizing women for any number of things. I won't recount the disgusting punishments they list for women alone, for doing anything against men, even if in self-defense (unless it was a defense against rape, those thoughtful Assyrians). Most of the code deals with really oddly intricate sexual circumstances and punishing women and men for them. Usually with mutilation and whipping, sometimes being turned into eunuchs. Now, in the Mosaic Law, we see the following above-and-beyond treatment of slaves: &bull; Killing a slave merited punishment. (Ex. 21:20) &bull; Permanently injured slaves had to be set free. (Ex. 21:26&ndash;27) &bull; Slaves who ran away from oppressive masters were effectively freed (Dt. 23:15&ndash;16). &bull; Slaves also got the same day of rest as all other Israelites. (Dt. 5:14) &bull; Slaves were to be treated as hired workers, not slaves (Lev 25:39&ndash;43) &bull; All slaves were to be freed after six years (Ex. 21:2) &bull; Freed slaves were to be liberally supplied with grain, wine and livestock (Dt. 15:12&ndash;15) &bull; Every fiftieth year (the year of jubilee), all Hebrew slaves were to be freed, even those owned by foreigners (Lev. 25:10 then 47&ndash;54) I don't see anything in Deuteronomy or Leviticus about whipping a woman till she's half dead for touching a man who didn't want to be touched. Slavery itself requires a larger discussion, though. 1 Peter 2 :18-19 Ephesians 6:5, Deuteronomy 20:10-11, Exodus 21:20-21, Exodus 21:7, Leviticus 25:44-46, numbers 5; these all talk about slavery. What about them, though? Something to remember is that humans are broken and flawed creatures. We also live in a fallen world with less than ideal circumstances. Therefore, things will happen to us, and we will be in circumstances, that are, in a word, awful. Slavery was a fact in the Ancient Near East, and unfortunately, it still is today; there are tens of millions of slaves around the world. In general, when you consider something in the Old Testament, consider the moral state of Israel's neighbors. They burned children alive in hopes of getting more crops. The other Ancient Near East legal codes we have show no respect for the sanctity of human life, and violent, disfiguring punishments were the norm. This is what God had to work with - people for whom that was the moral baseline. I would like you to imagine going to the antebellum American South and telling them that they shouldn't kill gay people, they shouldn't own black people, and women should be allowed to vote and make decisions. Or going to Saudi Arabia, and asserting any number of moral improvements. You'll be killed by a mob within the hour, or arrested and beheaded. Israel was incapable of following the standard we have.  So, when God gave the Israelites a legal code to follow, it had two purposes. One, to introduce the maximal amount of moral improvement they could be expected to tolerate, and to include many layers of protections and regulations for the less than ideal institutions they would have. Two, to separate them from their neighbor cultures, so they were less likely to commingle and thus fall even farther. We know God gave them exactly what they were able to tolerate because they couldn't, most of the time, even follow the one they had! They backslid into the same awful crimes and habits as their neighbors time and time again. Moral improvement of a culture takes time. See Matthew 19:8 for scriptural evidence of this: Jesus replied, &quot;Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.&quot;</p>

<p>We also find some reasoning, and evidence, for this in Acts 15:24-29. A letter was written to some new converts, and this is some of what it said: &quot;We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said. So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul&mdash; men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing. It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements: You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things.&quot;</p>

<p>Further along in Acts 17:29-30: &quot;Therefore since we are God's offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone&mdash;an image made by human design and skill. In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.&quot;</p>

<p> We see here that it's also merciful in a way to not overburden a group with more than they can bear - if the Israelites had been given everything expected of Christians, they would have failed. They couldn't even manage to keep up the standard they did have. Christians can't keep up the Christian standard! It's easy to say &quot;Oh God should have just laid perfection on them,&quot; but Christ himself said &quot;be perfect therefore,&quot; and I don't think it will shock anyone to find that Christians are far from perfect! So it is merciful, since violating a command is a sin, to lay less opportunity for sin on those who simply cannot bear it. That being said, it's worth noting that a slave in ancient times, or classical times, was not the same as what you saw in the Americas a few centuries ago. It was more a matter of economic status, generally. People chose to be slaves as well, so their master would provide for them. Specifically, race-based slavery is inherently condemned by the Bible: all men are created in the image of God, and therefore are equally valuable and worthy of respect. The sort of slavery done in the Americas, where people were stolen from their home lands and sold, would result in you being put to death in the Old Testament, Exodus 21:16: &quot;Anyone who kidnaps someone is to be put to death, whether the victim has been sold or is still in the kidnapper's possession.&quot;</p>

<p>Further, a man named Simon of Cyrene carried God's cross; Cyrene is in North Africa. Don't tell me God prefers white people when the man who he chose to carry his son's cross was an African (and the Jews were olive skinned&#8230;), but back to the topic at hand. Doesn't sound like God would approve of what was going on in Africa back then, does it? Whenever people cherry-pick verses in the Old or New Testaments about slavery, they're extremely careful to avoid including the many, many layers of protections afforded to them. See here in Deuteronomy 15, for example: &quot;If any of your people&mdash;Hebrew men or women&mdash;sell themselves to you and serve you six years, in the seventh year you must let them go free. And when you release them, do not send them away empty-handed. Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing floor and your winepress. Give to them as the Lord your God has blessed you. Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed you. That is why I give you this command today.&quot;</p>

<p>Let's examine the verses in Leviticus 25: &quot;Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property. You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly.&quot;</p>

<p>We've seen the rules on kidnapping; so what do you think this is discussing, given that kidnappers are to be put to death? That's right: foreigners who wish to sell themselves. As just shown in Deuteronomy 15, people back then sold themselves. Different time, different place. (Exodus 21:7-11 will be discussed later on after some more information has been established.)</p>

<p>What about bequeathing them and the like? There are rules for permanent slaves as well such as the year of Jubilee. Let's see the protections given to these foreigners in the next verses, still in Leviticus 25: &quot;Or if they prosper, they may redeem themselves. They and their buyer are to count the time from the year they sold themselves up to the Year of Jubilee. The price for their release is to be based on the rate paid to a hired worker for that number of years. If many years remain, they must pay for their redemption a larger share of the price paid for them. If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, they are to compute that and pay for their redemption accordingly. They are to be treated as workers hired from year to year; you must see to it that those to whom they owe service do not rule over them ruthlessly. &quot;'Even if someone is not redeemed in any of these ways, they and their children are to be released in the Year of Jubilee, for the Israelites belong to me as servants. They are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.&quot;</p>

<p>So every Year of Jubilee, all the slaves were to be released. And remember, they aren't just turned out to the wilds to fend for themselves, they were to be liberally supplied from your flock, winepress, and threshing floor (wheat, barley, etc.). Again, this is an unheard-of improvement of the treatment of servants and slaves over Israel's neighbors, especially considering these protections apply to foreigners!  On to Deuteronomy 20:10-11: &quot;When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you.&quot;</p>

<p>So, the verses specifically in Deuteronomy 20 are discussing warfare, and nowhere say &quot;you shall take them all as slaves.&quot; It says they may be subject to forced labor. The Law, as we've seen, forbids them from kidnapping them to be slaves or selling them as slaves under penalty of death, so it's hard to argue this is saying they may be taken as slaves. It's discussing a permission for war, and ruling over this foreign city. However, would you like to examine what other Ancient Near East cultures did when a city was won? Horrible calamities befell them, surrender or no. Subjecting them to forced labor, considering that God would remind the Israelites of their treatment under Egypt and demand they do better for these cities, is hardly advocating for chattel slavery. Likewise, this isn't a command for all peoples for all times: it's a permission for ancient Israel when they went to war. Exodus 21:20: &quot;Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result,&quot;</p>

<p>This verse allows for beating slaves, albeit that you will be charged for murder if they die. Corporal punishment offends our modern sensibilities, yes? So, knowing that, we are left with two interpretations of Exodus 21: 1. God is thus unreliable: corporal punishment is, according to me, never tolerable. This means God sanctioned evil. 2. God is thus reliable: even though to me corporal punishment is never tolerable, God made a provision for it, albeit with boundaries; this must mean that corporal punishment is in fact tolerable in certain situations. You see the difference? One relies on our own understanding of what good and evil are; the other knows that God, as the source of an objective morality, can differentiate better than us what good and evil are, and we must therefore arrive at the conclusion that in some situations, corporal punishment is tolerable. Remember, the laws given to Israel were all in the context of God bringing them up our of Egypt, and they would be reminded of and bearing in mind their treatment there as they read and applied this law. Someone who beat their slaves needlessly or excessively was not acting as God intended. Note that the next verse says this: &quot;Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property.&quot;</p>

<p>Most bruises take more than two days to recover! This does not allow for broken bones, beatings, or anything of the like. You might be able to get away with caning someone a few times under this if it's applied as written - hardly what atheists want you to imagine when they read this verse to you. No, they want you to picture the chattel slavery of the antebellum South, where slaves were locked in hot boxes, beaten mercilessly, whipped mercilessly. Such crimes would not be tolerated under the Old Testament Law, even less so under the New Covenant of Christ.  Also, recalling what I said in the first parts of this Special Article, any protection against physical abuse would have been laughed at in every other culture of the time. It's a marked moral improvement that their person was protected at all from abuse. Now it is time for Exodus 21:7-11: &quot;If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as male servants do. If she does not please the master who has selected her for himself, he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, because he has broken faith with her. If he selects her for his son, he must grant her the rights of a daughter. If he marries another woman, he must not deprive the first one of her food, clothing and marital rights. If he does not provide her with these three things, she is to go free, without any payment of money.&quot;</p>

<p> So what do we see here? At first, we go &quot;look the Bible is horrible it allows men to sell their daughters!&quot; And I know what you're picturing. You're picturing the girl being forcibly sold in chains to rest of her life. First, given what we've seen above, no, she can't be raped. She can't be beaten in any real sense of the word. Let's see the protections established in this verse: if she doesn't do a good job, she has to be 'redeemed.' He can't get rid of her, especially not to foreigners. If he decides she is to marry his son (remember, during this time period girls didn't have much choice&#8230; hard hearts and all), he has to make her his daughter. She's not just a sex doll for him. Second, if he marries someone else (the verse does not necessarily imply that he has married the servant girl), she is given powerful protections, or the right to go free.  On to slavery in the New Testament. First, see here in 1 Timothy 10&ndash;11: &quot;for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers&mdash;and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.&quot;</p>

<p>We see here a similar idea to one echoed in Exodus 21:16 (quoted above). Consider that as you read other verses that supposedly support slavery in the Bible. See here in Titus 2:9&ndash;12: &quot;Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them, and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive. For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. It teaches us to say &quot;No&quot; to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age,&quot;</p>

<p>The New Testament says that it is trying to make Christianity attractive to the masters; why do you think that is? A theme in the New Testament is &quot;the gospel comes first.&quot; If someone accepts the gospel, they are now suddenly a container for a wonderful good, and desire to be like Christ. Whatever sin you see someone committing will only be resolved by accepting the gospel. A slave master who (truly) accepts Christ will not be a slave master for long, and their treatment of their charges will dramatically improve in the meantime. You see, the gospel is the only important thing. Paul tells us in Ephesians and in Titus and elsewhere that our worldly station is irrelevant if we have the gospel. We are to do good and spread it no matter our circumstances. Now, of course, we are to strive for a higher standard of moral uprightness, hence the call for slaves to be as good as they can be, because of the gospel, so that they can spread it to their masters. We also see this not-so-subtle warning in Colossians 4:1: &quot;Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven.&quot;</p>

<p>Paul isn't saying &quot;hey slavery is great! Become a master! Own some slaves!&quot; He's issuing warnings and giving conduct standards to those who are. Paul is telling slaves in the verses he discusses slavery in (be it Ephesians or elsewhere) that since resisting is likely to only make their situation profoundly worse (think of what happened to most runaway slaves, and look up the aftermath of slave rebellions), they need to win over their masters with kindness and obedience, so that the masters want to hear the gospel, and all else will fall into place. This is the Bible's approach to reforming society, through love and grace. That's how you really end a cultural institution - change people's hearts so they no longer want to do it.</p>

<p>Numbers 5 is a protection for women whose husbands suspect them of being unfaithful. &quot;What? What makes you say that?&quot; In Numbers 5, we see a description of the procedure for when there is no &quot;witness and she wasn't caught in the act,&quot; but the husband still thinks her unfaithful. Consider your typical brutal, Ancient Near East culture. What precisely do you think will happen to the woman in all of them except Israel? She will be punished as if she had done it, because he believes she did. This happens today in first world countries, even (and others of course). And, a punishment is recognition that the thing itself is not good.</p>

<h2>Special Article E - Literally pierced, figuratively crushed</h2> <p> (This Special Article is referenced in the main text. It refers to the prophecy in Isaiah about the Suffering Servant, or the Messiah. Jesus is said to have been both crushed and pierced, and I only interpret the pierced literally when defending the prophecy as referring to Jesus Christ. What follows is why.) Once, when I asked &quot;why are we taking pierced literally but not crushed?&quot; I was told, &quot;well, Jesus was stabbed so we know that one is literal,&quot; and they didn't understand how circular that was when referring to prophetic accuracy. But thankfully, I do not have to rely upon bald circular logic here. If you look at the Hebrew for both pierce and crush, and then examine other Scriptural uses of those words, a distinction in use becomes apparent. See here, Job 19:2: &quot;How long will you torment me and break me in pieces with words?&quot;</p>

<p>I have chosen this one specifically to answer what being &quot;crushed&quot; means metaphorically as well. The &quot;break me in pieces&quot; there is the same Hebrew word used in Isaiah 53:5. Metaphorically, it's something like trample, smash, oppress, but with an overwhelming force. We see it used that way all over the Old Testament. For an example of Isaiah himself specifically using it this way, see Isaiah 19:10: &quot;Those who are the pillars of the land will be crushed, and all who work for pay will be grieved.&quot;</p>

<p>It's not intended that the esteemed of Egypt be literally crushed under rocks or something; but that they and their households will be smashed, brought to nothing. Now, pierced. The word I suppose most accurately means &quot;to bore [into something, wounding implied]&quot;, which is why you see &quot;pierced&quot; rendered as &quot;wounded&quot; sometimes, they change the focus (incorrectly in my view) from the boring to the implied wounding. Pierced is by far the more literal rendering. But what does that have to do with this? We're hitting the max of my understanding of Hebrew, here, but see this verse, Ezekiel 32:26: &quot;Meshech-Tubal is there, and all her multitude, her graves all around it, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they spread their terror in the land of the living.&quot;</p>

<p>Let me explain. There are three version of &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;. The rendering in Isaiah 53:5 begins with &#1502; (mem), which basically means &quot;from&quot; or &quot;because of&quot;. So we should look for &#1495;&#1500;&#1500; instead, because that's the root word. We find it here in Ezekiel 32:   Where the root word is used literally for people run through with a blade. Given that the overwhelming majority of uses for &quot;crush&quot; are metaphorical, and multiple uses of the root word for &quot;pierced&quot; (since the exact word is used nowhere else) are intended in a literal, stabbed context (see also Ezekiel 32:28), I feel confident saying it is reasonable to interpret pierced as literal and crushed as metaphorical. The point is, you could make an argument that pierced shouldn't be literal; but no one really does that that I've ever seen. If anything, the arguments I've seen against it are that it's saying the Suffering Servant was killed by the piercing instead of that he simply was pierced. But you can also make a strong argument that interpreting it literally is reasonable. Lastly, I've never heard of any Jewish person debating the metaphorical interpretation of &quot;crushed,&quot; but if someone were to do so I'd point them to the uses of it in Scripture as metaphor. So that's the point, at the end of it; we see &quot;crushed&quot; used metaphorically, and we see &quot;pierced&quot; used literally, so there is a basis for interpreting them in the way I have in the context of the Isaiah prophecy.</p>

<h2> Special Article F - Descendant of cursed king Jehoiachin</h2> <p> I was once asked, &quot;how can Jesus be King of Israel (John 1:49) if He is a descendant of King Jeconiah (Matthew 1: 11-12); who was cursed by God and Jeremiah said that none of his children would sit on David's throne (Jeremiah 22:30)?&quot; Always best to go to the verses. In Jeremiah 22 we find this: &quot;Record this man as if childless, a man who will not prosper in his lifetime, for none of his offspring will prosper, none will sit on the throne of David or rule anymore in Judah&quot;</p>

<p>The first cheeky thought doesn't work; you initially want to say &quot;well Jesus wasn't his offspring,&quot; but Jesus was called Abraham's offspring and that's way farther back, so that feels duplicitous. No, the simplest way I see is that the phrase &quot;in his lifetime&quot; applies to the whole verse. My evidence? Haggai 2:23:</p>

<p>&quot;'On that day,' declares the Lord Almighty, 'I will take you, my servant Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,' declares the Lord, 'and I will make you like my signet ring, for I have chosen you,' declares the Lord Almighty.&quot;</p>

<p>Zerubbabel was our fellow's grandson, and God showed him mercy in this way. Look a few verses earlier in Jeremiah 22, concerning Jehoiachin: &quot;As surely as I live,&quot; declares the Lord, &quot;even if you, Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, were a signet ring on my right hand, I would still pull you off.&quot;</p>

<p>The signet ring imagery is not a coincidence; God does not deal in coincidences. Thus, the &quot;in his lifetime&quot; interpretation would be my bet, and there is no contradiction here.</p>

<h2>Special Article G - The Unforgivable Sin</h2> <p> The unforgivable sin was something, keyword &quot;was,&quot; probably unique to that moment in time. Mark 3:22-30: &quot;And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, &quot;He is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons.&quot; So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables: &quot;How can Satan drive out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come. In fact, no one can enter a strong man's house without first tying him up. Then he can plunder the strong man's house. Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin.&quot; He said this because they were saying, &quot;He has an impure spirit.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Notice Jesus is responding directly to the charge that he is Satan; these men had no excuse. They knew precisely who he was, and they accused him of that. Clearly, Jesus considered that an unforgivable crime, and in verse 30, makes it clear that their charge is what he was referring to. Think about it: they accused the Holy Spirit of being Satan. The most good being, as if he were the worst being, with full knowledge and the worst intention. It's a unique crime.  A word of advice, though; I'm not entirely sure about that being exclusive to the Pharisees, so if I were you, I wouldn't go around telling people the Holy Spirit was evil. No, if the thought enters your head you aren't going to Hell. But if you intentionally and willfully level the accusation at the Holy Spirit, that he is evil when you should or do know that he is not and likewise know and understand who he truly is&#8230; best of luck to you friend. I don't know if it's still considered unforgivable or not. Jesus didn't put a time limit on any of his proclamations. It's an extremely serious charge, so much so that it caused Jesus Christ to withdraw his offer of salvation; the only time he ever did so by my counting. But don't be afraid. It's an easy thing not to do, since by virtue of not wanting to do it, you are essentially incapable of doing it. Isaiah 12:2: &quot;Surely God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid. The LORD, the LORD himself, is my strength and my defense; he has become my salvation.&quot;</p>

<h2>Special Article H - Practical Definition for Absolute Morality</h2> <p>You see, when there's a supreme God, over which there is no entity nor could, by definition of God, anything or any number of things ever surpass this entity, that God becomes the basis for an objective morality. Why? Well, what is morality? A definition would be: &quot;Principles concerning the distinction between good and bad actions and ideas.&quot; And who gets to define good and bad? Generally, everybody can do this: these are all subjective moralities, though. Now, the reason why only a supreme, creative God can set an objective (as opposed to subjective) morality is a bit subtle: in every instance, every possible instance even, Odin, who has supreme power mind you, will act and carry out consequences in the universe in line with his morality. Note these two reasons that make the supreme God's an objective one: 1. It applies everywhere and at all times both past and present; this means it is not dependent upon a subject 2. It cannot be challenged, overruled, or modified Mind that due to God's nature as unchanging, these facts are immutable. That is 'objectivity,' no? The definition of objectivity can be quibbled over, but in order for a word to be meaningful, it must have some differentiation from other words. What separates objectivity from subjectivity is whether something is an interpretation (i.e. requiring a subject), or a flat fact. And as just described, a supreme God can make his morality a flat fact, as he is unchanging, and nothing could prevail upon his will to make it anything but a flat fact, despite him being a subject - his morality, while requiring his person, prevails upon reality like a flat fact does. That implies objectivity. &quot;But what has that got to do with God necessarily being good?&quot; I'm getting there, don't think I have gotten lost on a tangent, but we are not quite done defending why God is necessarily good (despite not knowing what good is yet), and this is rather important. Stalin, for instance, could not force his subjectivity into objectivity, for a number of reasons. One, his view could be, and indeed was, challenged, by at the least the United States. Second, he only controlled one place; there were places where his views were not applied. Third, even in places where his rule was enforced, it did depend upon those enforcers in the first place, and further it could be resisted.  That is the difference between a subjective and an objective morality. God defines what is good, and because that definition becomes objective, his morality is necessarily good. Note, I am sometimes told this is circular: they say &quot;Dane, you've invented a circle: it's good because I say it's good, so we must accept it as good since we take it that God is good.&quot; But this is not quite what I am saying. I am saying that God has such a sheer force of will, such an omni-presence, that what he says is good, is for all intents and purposes, an objective good; it applies at all times, in all places. In a linguistically and practically worthless way, it is subjective, the subject being God, but by any practical or useful measure, it is objective.  All creatures, all of reality, all are held to this one unchanging standard; further, there is no way to escape this standard. Whatever standards may pop up inside of reality, they are all still secondary to it. Therefore, what this supreme God has defined as good, is good, for all practical intents and purposes. Speaking more to the circular argument, there is no fundamental definition of good that does not depend upon a subject; but that's because morality itself depends upon the presence of subjects. The whole thing is subject-to-subject interactions; our choices are to either become nihilists or be able to have useful discourse about the issue. Does that make sense? Theoretically, you cannot have an objective good. Practically, which is what matters, you can.</p>

<h2>Special Article I - Camus and Existentialism, a Christian Response</h2> <p> I have been asked, &quot;What should be the theist/Catholic response to existentialists like Camus who thought humans should embrace the meaninglessness of life and live 'authentically'?&quot; I'm going to focus on Camus, because I haven't read much Sartre nor do I care to. But Camus has a lot, actually, to say that is very useful for Christians. Camus himself was what one could call an absurdist, and that's what I'll be discussing: Camus' absurdism and the insights Camus had about our world in relation to God's truth. Let's make sure we're on the same page about absurdism: I'm arguing against a school of thought that says &quot;The universe is not inherently rational and has no purpose.&quot; Camus is a quixotic figure, but instead of windmills he's tilting at the very concepts of reason and purpose themselves. Camus himself said that man can't escape asking &quot;what's the reason I'm here?&quot; Of course, as I just stated, he finds that there is no answer to this question. He thinks we should just survive with an &quot;irresolvable emptiness.&quot; His philosophy hinges on this: &quot;it is absurd that we so desire to ask these questions and seek their answers, yet there are and can be no answers.&quot; My answer to this? You are correct, Camus. It is absurd, because there are answers to those questions. This is why I like Camus: he understood that there was something fundamental within us that drives us to ask those questions. That is a powerful thing for a theist to be able to rely upon when discussing such things with non-believers, is atheist philosophers who admit the very same. Camus admitted it made no sense, and we agree! It doesn't make sense, if you take as your conclusion that the universe is aimless and senseless. Camus' ideas are also dangerous, though, to individuals and communities who embrace the face of them but don't actually read him all the way. (Much like Christianity itself.) Someone who sees those conclusions would not be remiss in asking &quot;Why should I not just kill myself?&quot; Or, perhaps worse, &quot;Why should I not dominate others for my purposes?&quot; So you must be careful about him. (I must say, fools who don't understand Christianity and its focus on sacrificial love and servitude also come up with backwards, evil answers to these questions.) But back to it. He says of Sisyphus that he shows we can live with &quot;the certainty of a crushing fate, without the resignation that ought to accompany it&quot;. Again, to that I would say, you recognize the crushing fate, but you choose to ignore it? You choose to just say, &quot;nothing to be done about this!&quot; and go on? Nonsense. That is the absurd statement. There is a way to escape your &quot;crushing fate.&quot; Jesus Christ. He further says: &quot;All Sisyphus's silent joy is contained therein. His fate belongs to him. His rock is his thing&quot;. Camus, again, makes a profound insight here but ends it with wrong conclusions: yes, man needs something to give him purpose, something external. Camus calls Sisyphus the &quot;master of his days&quot;, but this is obviously wrong: Sisyphus is bound to move that rock up and down that hill for eternity. He is no master. Mere consciousness of something does not make you its owner. Perhaps it does in terms of you being able to control what meaning is ascribed to it, but that only works when there is no overriding, commanding, objective meaning applied - however Christians know that there is such a thing, since God is very much real. Camus wants you to establish your own meaning, your own profundity, for the absurdity of existence. But the theist rejects this: God has told us the meaning of life, he has told us the purpose of the universe and ourselves. There is no &quot;ultimate ignorance&quot; - sure, God has not told us everything, but he has told us what we need to know (2 Timothy 3:16&ndash;17). Now, there is more to say on Camus' philosophy, such as a thread of &quot;living for the present moment.&quot; One could say that Camus advocates for living without hope and without despair. Camus says something again with no small sense of profundity here, in Summer in Algiers: &quot;During their entire youth men find here a life in proportion to their beauty. Then, later on, the downhill slope and obscurity. They wagered on the flesh, but knowing they were to lose. In Algiers whoever is young and alive finds sanctuary and occasion for triumphs everywhere: in the bay, the sun, the red and white games on the seaward terraces, the flowers and sports stadiums. But for whoever has lost his youth there is nothing to cling to and nowhere where melancholy can escape itself. Elsewhere, Italian terraces, European cloisters, or the profile of the Provencal hills&mdash;all places where man can flee his humanity and gently liberate himself from himself. But everything here calls for solitude and the blood of young men.&quot; And he continues a sentence later: &quot;At Belcourt and Bab-el-Oued old men seated in the depths of cafes listen to the bragging of young men with plastered hair. Summer betrays these beginnings and ends to us in Algiers. During those months the city is deserted. But the poor remain, and the sky. We join the former as they go down toward the harbor and man's treasures &#8230; In the evening, sated with such wealth, they return to the oilcloth and kerosene lamp that constitute the whole setting of their life.&quot; I'm not quite sure how to parse into words what is being revealed here, but perhaps you get the picture of it by reading it yourself. What would the Christian's response be to this? Multiple things. First, the flesh is weak and fleeting. It is passing away, along with the whole rest of the world and its treasures (Matthew 6:19). We should instead build up treasure in heaven, not here on earth as Camus' young men do. Second, see here in Ecclesiastes 1:2, which is essentially a whole book of ripostes to Camus:</p>

<p>&quot;'Meaningless! Meaningless!' says the Teacher. 'Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless'&quot;</p>

<p>Some translations render &quot;meaningless&quot; as &quot;vanity&quot; or &quot;futility&quot;. There have been a number of good studies on exactly what Solomon means, but meaningless/futile/vain seem to capture the nuance well enough for me. See again in Ecclesiastes 1:14: &quot;I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.&quot;</p>

<p>From a Godless perspective, from Camus' perspective, everything is meaningless. Camus agrees with Solomon. This bears restating: Camus is generally correct in every regard about what life is apart from God. It is only with the presence of God that we find meaning, purpose, and hope. Nothing will satisfy you apart from God, is the meaning of Ecclesiastes. See verse 12:13: &quot;Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind&quot;</p>

<p>If someone presses you on Camus, the book of Ecclesiastes is your answer. There are (at least) ten vanities, and Camus would no doubt agree with them:</p>

<p>1. Human wisdom is meaningless (2:14&ndash;16) 2. Labor (2:18&ndash;23) 3.Amassing things (2:26) 4. Life itself (3:18&ndash;22) 5. Competition (4:4) 6. Selfish overwork (4:7&ndash;8) 7. Power and authority (4:16) 8. Greed (5:10) 9. Wealth and accolades (6:1&ndash;2) 10. Perfunctory religion (8:10&ndash;14) Without building your foundation upon Christ, indeed these things are nothing; when you die, they're gone. When we all die, they're gone. That is why I like Camus, he points you to the Gospel from the other way round, the inevitable conclusion of man should there be no God. He identifies the core contradiction of our yearning for purpose in a (to him) purposeless existence. The atheist will of course say &quot;it is only a failure of us, it does not highlight a contradiction in reality.&quot; But we see it for what it is: God has made us in his image, which means we want community like he does (he is triune, after all, community is part of his essence); this means we yearn to be connected to him, we yearn for his truths. We yearn for the eternal, which is the only way anything can truly matter: if it persists forever. Camus saw it, and we see it. He simply didn't find Christ's truth. Fortunately for us, we need not be lost in despair. 1 Thessalonians 4:13&ndash;14: &quot;But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep.&quot;</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 15:13&ndash;22 effectively summarizes the issue at hand: &quot;But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. &#8230; And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied. But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.&quot;</p>

<p>I think these verses say it better than I ever could (gee I wonder why, perhaps because God wrote them). This is the whole of our response. It occurs to me I didn't quite answer the question fully; there was a bit there about authenticity. The answer is rather simple: Camus' &quot;Authenticity Principle&quot; states that action should, in general, harmonize with one's knowledge. That is, one's knowledge should serve as that which determines action. Christians agree with this! If we have the knowledge of the truth, we are to follow God's commands (basically the whole book of 1 John). And see this from James 2: &quot;What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, &quot;Go in peace, be warmed and filled,&quot; without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.&quot;</p>

<p>We find all throughout the New Testament that if you have the knowledge of Christ, you are an heir of Christ, and should be working for the success of the household. This is in exact agreement with Camus. The knowledge of Christ determines how we should act.</p>

<h2>Special Article J - Josephus Didn't Mention Herod Killing Children?</h2> <p> I've heard it argued that Josephus didn't mention Herod's killing of all the children when Jesus was born. When I've been in the room when Christians were told this, I saw the reaction on their faces: &quot;Really? Josephus didn't mention such a dramatic event? That's not good.&quot; I in fact only include this in my work because of the shock I saw on their faces when told this - the common Christian may have heard of Josephus, and knows his importance to history in this period: to hear that he did not mention this event, thus, is shocking. But when you look beyond the face of it, there's no actual problem. The first question we should ask is, &quot;Would Herod have done this?&quot; The answer is a blinding &quot;yes, yes he would have.&quot; Herod, was known, by Josephus in point of fact, to have murdered anyone who could possibly threaten his throne. The Antiquities (Josephus's work) record a number of murders of people even vaguely capable of taking the throne, along with many details about his spy networks. He had several of his sons murdered as well (again, Antiquities). In the later years of his life, he executed 300 of his military commanders. Josephus even records a prophesy against Herod saying that his throne would be taken from him (Antiquities 17:42-45; LCL 8:393). As for someone recording it who is hostile to the faith, Macrobius, ca. AD 400, a pagan writer, in his book Saturnalia (2.4.11), wrote: &quot;When it was heard that, as part of the slaughter of boys up to two years old, Herod, king of the Jews, had ordered his own son to be killed, he [Emperor Augustus] remarked, 'It is better to be Herod's pig than his son.'&quot;  So why then didn't Josephus write it down? It's imminently possible Josephus, writing at the end of the first century AD, was unaware of a minor event that took place a century earlier. Josephus also got a good amount of his information from Herod the Great's personal historian. I can't really imagine a more suspicious source than the personal historian of a crazed, murderous man like Herod. Also the tragedy was likely nowhere near as large as people seem to think it would have been. Bethlehem probably had a population of 300 people, meaning there weren't even that many babies to be killed, so this is hardly a reportable tragedy to begin with. There was also rather a lot going on at the same time as this small episode, what with various festivals and other events. Josephus was furthermore writing for the Romans and Greeks, neither of whom would care about infant deaths in a far-off province. And of course, just because Josephus didn't record it does not mean it didn't happen.</p>

<h2>Special Article K - Is Hell Eternal or Temporary?</h2> <p> To start off with some background, there are broadly three camps with regards to Hell. The first is what I'll call &quot;Eternalists.&quot; They presume Hell is eternal punishment. Then we have &quot;Annihilationists,&quot; who believe Hell is a place where you go for a little while before being consumed. Finally, we have &quot;Denialists,&quot; who believe Hell doesn't exist at all and it's a metaphor for&#8230; something. Or they believe the common conception of Hell vastly overstates its horrors. Perhaps there is a theoretical fourth group, that I'll call &quot;Redempetivists,&quot; who believe Hell exists to remediate our sins so we can be with God, but I've never met one, so they're not much worth discussing. I won't waste much time on background here, but this Special Article will largely focus on why the Eternalist interpretation is the only biblically supported one. Diving right in, Annihilationists and Denialists often first bring up 2nd Peter 2:6 to defend their position: &quot;if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly;&quot;</p>

<p>Didn't Peter just plainly state that all the people were burned up, and they will be burned up in Hell? Well, for starters, we can't look at this verse in isolation: any anti-Hell people will always have to contend with Matthew 25:46 (the twin eternals, as I discuss in the work's main body). If you view it in connection with that, and other verses, it becomes apparent that what Peter is focusing on here is the burning itself, not the burning up. But more on that later.  Malachi 4 is often brought up next, I'll reproduce the chapter here: &quot;Surely the day is coming; it will burn like a furnace. All the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble, and the day that is coming will set them on fire,&quot; says the Lord Almighty. &quot;Not a root or a branch will be left to them. But for you who revere my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its rays. And you will go out and frolic like well-fed calves. Then you will trample on the wicked; they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day when I act,&quot; says the Lord Almighty. &quot;Remember the law of my servant Moses, the decrees and laws I gave him at Horeb for all Israel. &quot;See, I will send the prophet Elijah to you before that great and dreadful day of the Lord comes. He will turn the hearts of the parents to their children, and the hearts of the children to their parents; or else I will come and strike the land with total destruction.&quot;</p>

<p>If you are against eternal torment, you may read this and go &quot;aha! See? They are turned to ashes. Just like in 2nd Peter! Odd, Dane, that these references to it involve the evil being turned to ashes.&quot; For starters, analogies have ends. When, say, believers are compared to sheep, does the analogy not stop as us being completely senseless? Does it not stop at us not having four feet? This analogy is also repeated multiple times in the Bible, so mere repetition of an analogy with a specific component does not automatically make that component more real. You must remember that. Second, and more importantly, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was of the physical presence of those people and those places. Those people were quite literally turned to ash by the flame. As Lamentations 4:6 says: &quot;The punishment of my people is greater than that of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment without a hand turned to help her.&quot;</p>

<p>Sodom and Gomorrah were consumed by the flame, which went away. Whereas in verses like Mark 9:43, we see this: &quot;If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into Hell, where the fire never goes out.&quot;</p>

<p>What is the purpose of a flame that does not go out&#8230; if it consumes the sinners in an instant, and then is empty? See further on in Mark 9: &quot;And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into Hell, where 'the worms that eat them do not die, and the fire is not quenched.' Everyone will be salted with fire.&quot;</p>

<p>So, the worms don't die, and the fire won't be quenched, and note that it says everyone will be salted with fire. What is the purpose, or what was the purpose I should say, of salt at that time? As a preservative. You will be doused and preserved by the flames in Hell. The flame is called eternal multiple times &ndash; also, see this example in 2 Thessalonians 1:9: &quot;They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might&quot;</p>

<p>That word, everlasting, is also used to refer to eternal life in Matthew 19:16, Mark 10:30&#8230; and is of course used to refer to the flames of Hell many times (Matthew 25:41, 18:8, etc.). The word &quot;destruction&quot; may be more aptly rendered as &quot;ruin&quot; &ndash; note I am not trying to worm out of the use of destruction, but explain its inclusion next to the word &quot;eternal.&quot; See this use of it in 1 Timothy 6:9: &quot;Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, which word, 'ruin' or 'destruction' &ndash; do you think is the same Greek word as the one in Thessalonians? By my asking, you may guess that it is actually ruin. Hence, the word destruction given in Thessalonians is more correctly rendered as ruin, given the context of eternal being paired with it.  So, on the one hand, we have metaphorical references to the fire, and then we have the verses that literally describe the fire. The more specific, literal depictions are of eternal flame. This lends significance credence to the idea that the analogies are being taken too far by the Annihilationists and Denialists. They turn to the analogies instead of the literal depictions; if they were right, there would be a contradiction in Scripture. So, we can only conclude that the death is eternal. But I want to return to Malachi 4 briefly, specifically this:  &quot;See, I will send the prophet Elijah to you before that great and dreadful day of the Lord comes.&quot;</p>

<p>A certain annihilationist site, that I won't reference here as I won't be directing readers to them, says this of that reference in Malachi: &quot;first, and most importantly, the argument that Malachi 4 was entirely fulfilled in Jesus's coming should give us pause because it basically makes no sense. The reference to Elijah is a difficulty that must be overcome by those who say that this passage describes the end of the world. &#8230; How exactly did Jesus's first coming eliminate the wicked completely, as the imagery suggests? How are they left with neither root nor branch? What event on earth, either that has happened or could happen, would be anything like the imagery suggests? Now, one could say that Jesus began the process by his first coming. I would agree. But the events of Malachi 4:1-3 still have not happened.&quot; What a misconception of the nature of Christ's death and resurrection this is! Did Christ's coming not signify the end? Tetelestai, that powerful word of Christ: &quot;it is finished.&quot; How are they left with neither root nor branch? Remember Christ's own parable of the tree? See here in Romans 15:12, Paul referencing Isaiah: And again Isaiah says, &quot;The root of Jesse will come, even he who arises to rule the Gentiles; in him will the Gentiles hope.&quot;</p>

<p>Who is the root? Christ! The wicked thus do not have the root. And what about the branch? See here in Romans 11:11-31: But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree, do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you. Then you will say, &quot;Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.&quot; That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but fear.</p>

<p>So, we see here that the unbelieving branches will be and have been through Christ cut off from the root. So when someone tells you that Malachi suggests the wicked have been completely defeated and that hasn't happened&#8230; well, they have. By Christ. If they say that Malachi 4 has not happened with reference to the victory of Christ as Elijah coming, they are woefully incorrect.  In short, when taken in conjunction with Matthew 25:46, in which the same word for eternal is paired with life and punishment, we find that the analogies given in the common verses that support Hell as being temporary are a case of analogies being taken past their means. The verses that discuss Hell in a literal sense all call it eternal.</p>

<h2>Special Article L - Inherited Sin-Liability and Sin vs. Iniquity</h2> <p> &quot;What about us being liable for other sins? I've heard something about us being punished for the sins of our father to the third generation.&quot; I always argue that the 'third generation' comment is more a reflection of the causal effects of sin, i.e. if your grandfather was a drunkard, I imagine your life station has been in some way reduced by his failures (this is what Scripture calls iniquity, the corruption, as opposed to culpability, that infects those who sin). Another apt example is that if your grandmother, while late in pregnancy with your mother, did drugs or the like&#8230; the eggs, i.e., half of your genetic material, inside your mother would be affected by that. But, aside from that, what does Scripture actually say about our responsibility for the sins of our fathers? We turn to Ezekiel 18, where God, through Ezekiel, brings up a proverb where the parents eat sour grapes, and their children's mouths pucker. (Note this instance of sour grapes is distinct from Aesop's fable about the fox and grapes that he cannot reach being sour.) God literally says this: &quot;As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, you will no longer quote this proverb in Israel. For everyone belongs to me, the parent as well as the child&mdash;both alike belong to me. The one who sins is the one who will die.&quot;</p>

<p>Clearly, he does not like the association between him and this idea of inherited guilt. God then uses an example of a violent man, and God declares the violent son will face judgement. This violent man, though, has a righteous son of his own, and this is God's explanation: &quot;Will such a man live? He will not! Because he has done all these detestable things, he is to be put to death; his blood will be on his own head. But suppose this son has a son who sees all the sins his father commits, and though he sees them, he does not do such things. He will not die for his father's sin; he will surely live. But his father will die for his own sin, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother and did what was wrong among his people. Yet you ask, 'Why does the son not share the guilt of his father?' Since the son has done what is just and right and has been careful to keep all my decrees, he will surely live. The one who sins is the one who will die. The child will not share the guilt of the parent, nor will the parent share the guilt of the child. The righteousness of the righteous will be credited to them, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against them.&quot;</p>

<p>God then continues here: &quot;But if a wicked person turns away from all the sins they have committed and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right, that person will surely live; they will not die. None of the offenses they have committed will be remembered against them. Because of the righteous things they have done, they will live. Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign Lord. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live? But if a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin and does the same detestable things the wicked person does, will they live? None of the righteous things that person has done will be remembered. Because of the unfaithfulness they are guilty of and because of the sins they have committed, they will die.&quot;</p>

<p>Seems reasonable to me. If you, at the end, refuse God, you will be held liable. If you, at the end, recognize your faults and appeal to grace, you will be forgiven. It matters what state you are in when you go to God; see the parable of the Workers in the Vineyard in Matthew 20:1-16 for this logic's mirror under the new covenant.  But in short, you are not going to be inheriting liability for sins. But! What about Nehemiah chapter 9? First, Psalm 32:5 uses three different words: &quot;I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not cover my iniquity; I said, 'I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,' and you forgave the iniquity of my sin.&quot;</p>

<p>Iniquity is, essentially, the twistedness that results from sin. (Transgressions are serious crossing the line type behaviors.) Iniquity is corruption, not culpability. Nehemiah chapter 9 is a case study in iniquity and sin. Verses 16-35 concern the iniquity of the current generation in relation to their ancestors, and show us that corruption, while not culpability, does persist across persons and generations. Again, one more verse to close the book on the idea you can be held responsible for your parents' sins, Deuteronomy 24:16: &quot;Fathers shall not be put to death because of their children, nor shall children be put to death because of their fathers. Each one shall be put to death for his own sin.&quot;</p>

<h2>Special Article M - The &quot;Genocides&quot; of 1 Samuel 15 and Deuteronomy 20</h2> <p> So, what about 1 Samuel 15, and Deuteronomy 20? People very often find these to be troubling passages. As for some background, the Amalekites had been attacking Israel for literal generations. We see them mentioned all the way back in Exodus, even, and Moses was involved with them. Deuteronomy 25:17: &quot;Remember what the Amalekites did to you along the way when you came out of Egypt. When you were weary and worn out, they met you on your journey and cut off all who were lagging behind&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>Frankly, I'm sick of &quot;justifying&quot; these stories to people. I'm proud of them, and here's why (I am referring to 1 Samuel 15 and Deuteronomy 20). The Amalekites were persistent in their efforts to destroy Israel. They were an evil, awful people. What we find in the story of the Amalekites is a very real, very human story about what kinds of things happen between people groups. If stories like this were not in Scripture, people would accuse it of being fantastical fairy tales for kids; with stories like it in, they accuse it of being brutal. There is no winning with some. This particular story gave hope to a people group who was and is constantly oppressed. &quot;See how the Lord saves us from those who would destroy us without cause,&quot; Rabbis have said. This story tells us that God's love for Israel is fierce, and real. If someone keeps coming into your house and harming your children, day after day, will you say &quot;just coexist with them,&quot; and do nothing? Only if you care nothing for your children. If you have ever been seriously wronged by another out of malice, you know the safety of a God who is not afraid to pick up a sword and solve the problem. I find that people who judge the story in 1 Samuel 15 never bother to learn the history. They never bother to look at it through any eyes but their own; disinterested and oh so safe, many millennia and miles away. They don't even look around these two verses. Here's the thing, this story isn't for you, if you're sitting cozy in the first world with this book out in the open. This story is for the Christians of the Middle East today, who are being slaughtered and legislated out of existence. It's for the Christians in Nero's coliseum having their organs ripped out with hooks. &quot;Look here,&quot; God says, &quot;I'm coming with fire and fury, and I am angry.&quot; I must second point to how calling this a &quot;genocide&quot; is a sign that you haven't read these books very closely, because if you look at other such &quot; genocides&quot; in Scripture you quickly see that this is staple ancient grandstanding. Look here, in 1 Samuel 30, which takes place after the command to kill all the Amalekites: &quot;David and his men reached Ziklag on the third day. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag and burned it, and had taken captive the women and everyone else in it, both young and old. They killed none of them, but carried them off as they went on their way.&quot;</p>

<p>Who do we see here? The Amalekites. It was extremely common for ancient rulers to use this hyperbolic language of &quot;oh I killed them all, I salted their fields, their babies I used as footstools.&quot; Everyone knew what was up. Not one ancient person saw the command in 1 Samuel 15 to kill them all and Saul reporting it done, and then the same people showing back up in 1 Samuel 30, as a contradiction.</p>

<p>Upon reading this, I received a reply: &quot;Let's not forget that your god also specifically instructed genocide against the Canaanites because they 'sinned' - so his little lackey Joshua went about his work quite thoroughly according to that book of horror you call the OT. Do you think there were no children among the Canaanites?&quot; Ah yes, the Canaanites, another group who were &quot;totally destroyed.&quot; Here are the verses: &quot;Completely destroy them&mdash;the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites&mdash;as the Lord your God has commanded you. Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods, and you will sin against the Lord your God.&quot;</p>

<p>Look here in a later chapter: &quot;Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast heard how the Lord had dried up the Jordan before the Israelites until they had crossed over, their hearts melted in fear and they no longer had the courage to face the Israelites.&quot;</p>

<p>Oops. Like I said, classic ancient hyperbole. But that's not what is important. When I look at 1 Samuel 15, I go &quot;look here! This is a real God with real love who defends his people and tackles problems head on! I pray he'll order my defense so vigorously from wicked men!&quot;</p>

<p>Just like he did with Jesus. He ordered his Son to die to save me from wickedness, my own wickedness in fact. God does not change. He does not contradict his love for his children on even one page of Scripture; he always defends his flock from wickedness, be it from within or without. In the West our enemies may not so flagrantly attack the Church with guns and laws, but we attack ourselves with sin. And don't forget that in other parts of the world, they very much do visit real destruction upon Christian communities. To them, I know for a fact that a God willing to defend them is a holy comfort.</p>

<p>But to finish out the argument about the Canaanites, the detractor's reply: &quot;Don't bother with 'But they appear later on' - you're missing the point. They were ordered by the very origin of love and compassion to slaughter every man, woman and child.&quot;</p>

<p>Ah but they were not ordered to do that, which is my point. That's why they are still there later on, in all cases of &quot;genocide&quot; - they were not ordered to slaughter every man, woman, and child; that's what hyperbole means.  &quot;I would like to know which cultures today do you feel are evil and barbaric and need to be destroyed? Because it seems to me that you're quite fond of killing your god's enemies? Perhaps I am one of those people as I most assuredly despise your god? Should I be killed?&quot;</p>

<p>I don't have, nor do I want, the right to make that decision, only God can make that decision. Note what happened to the Israelites when they took the ark and marched into battle against the Philistines without God's approval. It turned out very, very poorly for Israel, such that they lost the ark. This is a complicated issue, I will say (I don't mean the obviously inflammatory remarks). We have some psalms, called the &quot;imprecatory&quot; psalms, that are prayers for this kind of martial deliverance. They are reserved for flagrant assaults upon the Church and God's work, but Christians are counseled to always leave room for God's grace. That is always the final word, James 2:13: &quot;&#8230;because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment.&quot;    So for me, I pray for the deliverance of the world from sin, not for its destruction. Because I was showed mercy, and so I should ask for mercy for others. We are instructed to &quot;Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed. Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.&quot;</p>

<p>Rescuing the weak and needy, delivering them from the wicked&#8230; these sometimes require arms and violence. Not always, and the Christ-centered person will seek to avoid violence, but if it comes to it&#8230; so it comes to it. Romans 12:18: &quot;If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, someone slapping you when you 'turn the other cheek' is more to do with insults. However, when it is just, we are told to defend ourselves from accusations, Luke 12:11&ndash;12: &quot;When you are brought before synagogues, rulers and authorities, do not worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say, for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say.&quot;</p>

<p>Clearly, defending ourselves is appropriate at times. This speaks of words and is directed at the Apostles, but it reveals to us that we are not to lie down and let injustice or evil stand against us. How far does that go? Consult Scripture, pray, and ask other mature Christians in the Church. There is no axiomatic rule, for there is no axiomatic situation with a spherical cow. Oh and, the command is &quot;do not murder,&quot; not &quot;do not kill,&quot; so no one email me about that. In my conversation with the detractor above, he eventually said this: I would try to destroy anybody who got into my house, but I'm not the one who is guided by some 'higher power.'  Which spoke volumes to me, frankly. In his view, it was perfectly fine for his personal morality to guide him to defend his property, family, and self, but it is somehow not fine for someone guided by God's perfect standard to do the same. I found that very telling, and one only need think for a few moments how it applies to the entirety of this discussion about martial retribution being used by God. We should stray a moment into Habakkuk. Let's look at the first few verses: &quot;Lord, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not hear? Or cry to you 'Violence!' and you will not save? Why do you make me see iniquity, and why do you idly look at wrong? Destruction and violence are before me; strife and contention arise. So the law is paralyzed, and justice never goes forth. For the wicked surround the righteous; so justice goes forth perverted.&quot;   We can't have it both ways. We cannot say, &quot;God's chosen way of getting rid of evil is evil,&quot; but then also say, &quot;why does God allow evil to persist?&quot; We cannot say, &quot;I don't like the way God gets rid of evil,&quot; while also saying &quot;If there's a God he's sovereign so why doesn't he do anything?&quot; The duplicity is ridiculous. In the main body of the work I focused on the problem of evil, and so I won't rehash that here, but you see the impossibility of satisfying some people. Anyways, in response to Habakkuk, God says he's raising up the Babylonians to execute his judgement (Habakkuk 1:12). See here: &quot;O Lord, you have ordained them as a judgment, and you, O Rock, have established them for reproof. You who are of purer eyes than to see evil and cannot look at wrong, why do you idly look at traitors and remain silent when the wicked swallows up the man more righteous than he?&quot;</p>

<p>God's response is, in effect, that they will be punished for their wrongdoing later on as well. Again, if your first question is, &quot;why not just get rid of it all right now,&quot; that has been answered in the main body of the text. Don't forget that if God simply &quot;got rid of evil,&quot; he'd simply get rid of you too, since he shows no favoritism. Instead, he wants us to come to repentance, and so he is patient.</p>

<h2> Special Article N &ndash; Is faith a choice or part of the gift? (Calvinism)</h2>

<p>This Special Article deals with the question of whether people choose to have faith or not, after the gospel and Holy Spirit do their work in them. (I'll make that blindingly plain: you cannot have faith without God calling to you.) More formally and theologically, the argument mostly hinges upon whether or not faith is a &quot;work&quot; as described in Scripture. I would define work loosely as an action one performs in expectation of a reward or result. Scripture teaches in no uncertain terms that absolutely no work you do can save you. Relying on your works in any way, shape, or form for salvation will get you to one place and one place only: Hell.  I should also define faith, which Hebrews 11:1 helpfully does for us:  &quot;Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus, the question depends partially on if faith itself is a work. A common question is whether or not faith is part of the gift described in Ephesians 2:8-9. The wording in the Greek does not support that faith is the gift: &quot;For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.&quot;</p>

<p>The issue here is that &quot;this&quot; in the second sentence is neuter in the Greek, and faith is feminine. I won't go too much into this here, but that negates the premise that &quot;faith&quot; is necessarily connected to &quot;this&quot;. All the words, in fact, are masculine or feminine; thus, the conclusion is that &quot;this&quot; is referring to the whole phrase, the whole idea: &quot;for by grace you have been saved through faith.&quot; &quot;So grace is the gift, saved is the gift, and faith is the gift?&quot; No, that would require &quot;these.&quot; It is &quot;this.&quot; This is not plural.  Now, Calvinists such as Voddie Baucham has been known to say, &quot;dead men can't make choices.&quot; He is, of course, referencing Ephesians 2 which calls us dead in our trespasses and sins. But what he misses is that this is followed by &quot;in which you once walked&quot;: walking is an action. Dead does not mean incapable of action (action is divorced from the Scriptural concept of work). If the Holy Spirit rouses you, you are capable of responding even if 'dead' as Paul describes. More importantly, what Baucham and others, Calvin himself included, miss is that the gospel is alive. I can summarize this no better : &quot;When Calvinists insist that unregenerate, natural man is spiritually dead, remind them that the Gospel is alive. The Gospel is &quot;living and active&quot; (Hebrews 4:12), gives faith (Romans 10:17), cleans (John 15:3), washes (Ephesians 5:26) contains life (John 6:63) and makes you born again. 1st Peter 1:22-23 states: 'Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart, for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God.' It also pricks and convicts. (Acts 26:14; John 16:8) Besides this, a man does not receive the indwelling of the Holy Spirit until after he has heard and believed in the Gospel. (Ephesians 1:13; Galatians 3:2)&quot; There's plenty of Scriptural backing that faith is not a work, Romans 3:27 for starters: &quot;Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith.&quot;</p>

<p> Romans 4:4-5 clearly separates works and faith: &ldquo;Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness,&rdquo;</p>

<p> Galatians 2:16 separates the &lsquo;law&rsquo;, which is all good works, and faith: &ldquo;yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith is a difference between me and the damned, but what made me different was Christ's work. Faith does not merit anything. The calvinist will say, &quot;man must cooperate with God to be saved so it is a work,&quot; but it is not a work, so this is their flawed description of the role faith plays; co-operate has operate within. Trust is not &quot;operating&quot; anything.  &quot;What about John 6:44? It says no one can come unless the Father draws them.&quot; Yeah, of course. No one seeks God on their own. The Holy Spirit does the work, the gospel does the work, I merely assent to it. Certainly, God can override our choice. He is sovereign! He does not need us to do anything. But choosing to trust in the Lord's works is not a work. Calvinists will argue all day that it is a work, but that's simply not supported by the text.  While Scripture is the final arbiter of all doctrinal matters, think about this rationally: if I have total faith in Jesus, truly, then I cannot possibly have any faith in myself, which means I admit and recognize that I am totally reliant on the effort of the Lord to save me. Again, trying to answer this from reason gets you into all kinds of trouble, so this isn&rsquo;t an argument I&rsquo;m making, it&rsquo;s just something to consider. Scripture is the sole authority on whether or not faith is a work, and it says &ldquo;no.&rdquo; &quot;What about election?&quot; I don't frankly know why so many have so much trouble with this, and yes, election is extremely, plainly-from-the-mouth-of-Christ Scriptural; the solution is very simple: he made me with a will that would say yes when called to by the Holy Spirit, or any other number of explanations that satisfy Romans 9:23. Then there's the example of Jacob and Esau, where God demonstrates he can sovereignly pick whoever he pleases. Jacob and Esau were twins, and the only difference between them at all that humans would find to choose one over the other was that Jacob came out second; God ignored even that! Calvinists will also say &quot;So you believe grace is resistible?&quot; and call that blasphemy or say that it cheapens God's power. Friends, brothers, sisters, look at Israel in the Old Testament, and look me in the eye and tell me that God does not sovereignly allow us to resist his grace! So, let's continue on to Romans 10:17 which in no uncertain terms tells us the source of faith: &quot;Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ.&quot;</p>

<p>Faith comes from the living gospel, interpreted to our spiritually blind deaf and dumb minds by the Holy Spirit. Frustratingly, &quot;comes from&quot; here is ex, from which we ex-otic among other. I probably don't need to tell you that this is not exactly a theologically specific word here, so there's not much of a conclusion that can be drawn from it. It doesn't matter, though, as no matter what sort of definition for &quot;comes from&quot; we mean, it does not say that we inevitably accept that faith. It leaves room for whether or not we accept that faith is our choice. 1 Thessalonians 2:13-14 says the following in support of this conclusion: &quot;And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers.&quot;</p>

<p>We see that Paul says &quot;you accepted it.&quot; He ascribes agency to the accepting of the word to the individual, and also, says that the word of God is doing the work in us.</p>

<h2> Special Article O &ndash; An example of God waiting to punish and cultural justice</h2>

<p> I am not, in this Special Article, going to write an entire treatise on God's waiting to punish sin and why and why that is right. An entire chapter of this work handles that issue. Additionally, one need read very little of the prophet Isaiah (or Scripture in general) to find the cycle of the buildup of the corruptive iniquity of sin before God's wrath comes crashing down, followed by redemption of the remnant and upkeep of the promise. Further, this is not a rehashing of the Special Article concerning inherited guilt, though it may briefly discuss similar topics.  Here, I intend to discuss one curious example of such: Genesis 15:13-16:  &quot;Then the Lord said to Abram, 'Know for certain that your offspring will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there, and they will be afflicted for four hundred years. But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions. &#8230; And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.&quot;</p>

<p> God is, of course, speaking to Abraham, and telling him about the fate of his forebears. Note the last clause though, 'for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete'. What an odd statement! How can God wait for a people's corruption to be &quot;complete&quot; before punishing them?   Partly, the resolution is that the Amorites had not yet sinned to such a degree, their culture had not become so violently, disgustingly repulsive to God to warrant their total destruction and dissolution and &quot;vomiting from the land&quot;, but that it would four hundred years hence. But we need way more context to isolate this. Genesis 18 where God said he would spare Sodom for increasingly few hypothetical righteous persons, and then in Genesis 19 he does spare Lot from the destruction visited upon Sodom. That example is used all throughout Scripture as typifying God's justice for a reason, and not just because of the awesome power of the destruction, but for the saving of those who were not corrupted enough to warrant that level of calamitous destruction.  See also Jeremiah 24, whereby God showed the prophet Jeremiah two baskets of figs; one good, and one rotten, inedible. God then explains that the good figs will be preserved through the trials and tribulations of their future captivity in Babylon, and the bad figs, well. Verses 9 and 10 speak for themselves.   And here, Isaiah 14:20-21:  &quot;You will not be joined with them in burial, because you have destroyed your land, you have slain your people. May the offspring of evildoers nevermore be named! Prepare slaughter for his sons because of the guilt of their fathers, lest they rise and possess the earth, and fill the face of the world with cities.&quot;</p>

<p> (This is part of a taunt against the king of Babylon.) What to make of this? On the face of it, it seems like the king's sons are being slaughtered for what their father has done, but it is not so. First, their ages are not given, and this is a generic taunt against the king of Babylon, not a specific one, so we cannot say which king and thereby derive the ages of the sons or anything of the sort. But the solution does not change if they are adults, teenagers, children, or a mix.   Much like the question, &quot;Why did God kill infants and children in the flood?&quot; We find that the answer is partially, &quot;because they would have or already were corrupted by the iniquity of their culture.&quot; (And of course God did not owe them time on this earth, et cetera, not the focus here.) The sons of the king of Babylon, as stated in the verses, would infect the earth with their hideous culture. Isaiah 14 describes this king as &quot;the man who made the earth tremble, who shook kingdoms, who made the world like a desert and overthrew its cities, who did not let his prisoners go home&quot;; the man who even the trees were happy to be rid of! Trees! So God says, &quot;no more of those like you.&quot;    This is where Exodus 20:5 comes into play:  &quot;You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me,&quot;</p>

<p> Which is the opposite of Proverbs 20:7:  &quot;The righteous who walks in his integrity&mdash; blessed are his children after him!&quot;</p>

<p> Exodus 20:5 is best kept in its context, of the sin of idolatry. Idolatry is a pernicious, foul thing. It is so corrupting that it lasts for three or four generations. Note also that it says &quot;the fathers,&quot; not &quot;a father.&quot; This is a cultural issue, not a specific family one. Again, see Special Article L on the issue.  Which is all the various context for Genesis 15:16. Phew! Alright, with all that said, what we see is three things: First, God always leaves room for repentance. We can all be glad we have our lives to repent; God could have struck any Christian down the day before he called them. Any individual Amorite can be expected to have received this as much as anybody, and to have been shown mercy. The Assyrians in Nineveh had this chance, and they took it, and were spared (much to the chagrin of Jonah, of course). Second, It is up to God when he punishes sin; he decided that he would let the Amorites go for probably more reasons than one, but they would occupy the promised land until it was time for Abraham's descendants to have it, which fit together elegantly. I mention this, though, because Sodom and Gomorrah were both in Canaan; their evil was such that God destroyed them then and there. So this is not that God lets rampant, horrible evil go unchecked endlessly; he allowed a cultural virus to persist until it was proper for it to be removed, and he decided that time was later on than for Sodom and Gomorrah. For instance, Genesis 14:13 tells us: &quot;Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner. These were allies of Abram.&quot;</p>

<p>That one of Abraham's allies was an Amorite; thus, we can see they had not been all consumed by evil as they would be when it came time for their destruction. Third, the Amorites were an idolatrous people. Exodus 20:5 just told us the fate of those who are idolatrous.  Lastly, look at these verses from Luke 13: &quot;When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, open to us,' then he will answer you, 'I do not know where you come from.' Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.' But he will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of evil!' In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves cast out.&quot;</p>

<p>Notice anything? The unrepentant Amorites lost their homeland; God says, &quot;I don't know where you come from.&quot; It is speculation, perhaps, that these are truly related, but I still find a poignant truth contained therein, that the sinner, the worker of evil, has no homeland, and if you are not a citizen of Zion you are a citizen of nowhere. It also reinforces the truth that God decides when he closes the door to his own home. Who are we to say, &quot;You should close the door early,&quot; or &quot;You should close the door later,&quot; or &quot;You should close the door to them,&quot; or &quot;You should let me in&quot;?</p>
