<h1>THE CRITICAL TRIPLET &amp; THE NON-MIRACULOUS NOW</h1>
<p>Bertrand Russell is a name that comes up sometimes, if you dabble in philosophy. Actually, I almost named this section &quot;Bertrand's Triplet,&quot; but decided against it, because he did not originate this challenge nor was he its greatest proponent. I, as a big fan of the Old Testament prophecies of Jesus, had something of a facepalm d'oh moment when I realized that I had failed to write in any great measure about the prophecies of Jesus, as in, those given by the Son of Man himself. There are three sets of verses that come up quite frequently as being supposedly rather difficult for Christians to handle. In point of fact, I would have made this discussion a Special Article, were it not for the fact these verses clearly trouble many Christians. True, if these verses said what is claimed, we'd be in deep water: critics claim they say that Christ was supposed to return before 100 AD and other such things. Problematic if so!  But without further ado, here they are, and their explanations. Frankly I feel I've set them up too much, for they have almost disappointingly simple explanations. Critics will really twist anything they can, I suppose.  Matthew 10:23 is the first: &quot;When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next, for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.&quot;</p>

<p> This first one is purported to say &quot;Christ meant that when his followers had visited all the towns of Israel his second coming wound occur.&quot; But if you read Matthew 10, there's&#8230; no evidence that this refers to the end times coming of Christ, I mean none. He doesn't frankly explain what he's referring to much at all. You could just as easily say it means &quot;before he goes to Jerusalem to his death and comes into glory&quot; as anything. I frankly don't even understand why this one is so heavily cited; it's grasping at straws at best.     Luke 9:27:  &quot;But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.&quot;</p>

<p> If you read literally five verses before this one, in 9:22, Christ talks about his coming death. This makes it apparent that Christ is talking about his coming death and resurrection. Again, I really don't understand why critical scholars try to assign a meaning to this that is above what is obviously there. There's no mention whatsoever of the end times, unless you torture the phrase &quot;kingdom of God&quot; to mean something unsupported by the phrase's use all over the New Testament by Jesus himself.   The third text is more or less the whole of Mark chapter 13, narrowly rendered as verses 14-30. They describe incredible destruction and woe with intense apocalyptic language. The verse of contention, though, is verse 30:  &quot;Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.&quot;    What we are dealing with is a critical claim that can be summarized thusly: &quot;This passage clearly states that Christ's second return would occur, by any reasonable definition, promptly, not more than two thousand years later.&quot;  My argument, stated equally succinctly, is that the actual prophesy contained in these verses, and their parallels in the other gospels, was fulfilled in 70 AD with the destruction of Jerusalem by Rome. If you aren't familiar with the events of 70 AD, here's a rough summary. The Jews had revolted, and the Roman general Titus, sent by the emperor Vespasian (who replaced Nero) laid siege to Jerusalem as part of the Roman campaign against the rebels. The Romans surrounded the city in an attempt to starve out the defenders. In short order, they breached the walls and destroyed the Second Temple.  In Mark 13:2, Jesus predicts the destruction of the temple, and indeed Jerusalem itself. The other gospels mention that Israel would be surrounded by armies (notably Luke 20) and such other things. So we're talking about the destruction of Jerusalem, as it occurred in 70 AD. See this section from Mark, 13:24-27:  &quot;But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.&quot;</p>

<p> First, we see here standard apocalyptic cosmic destruction. Isaiah 13:9-11: &quot;See, the day of the Lord is coming &mdash;a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger&mdash; to make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it. The stars of heaven and their constellations will not show their light. The rising sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light. I will punish the world for its evil, the wicked for their sins. I will put an end to the arrogance of the haughty and will humble the pride of the ruthless.&quot;</p>

<p>Same stuff, but about a similar relatively local judgement by God. Hence why it's called apocalyptic literature; it's necessarily grandiose in its descriptions. The rest of Isaiah 13 confirms for us that this is the case, since after these descriptions, it's revealed that the prophecy concerns the conquest of the Babylonians by the Medes. Obviously, there were still believing Jews after that event, so that tells us that no one saw this and went &quot;See, God said he would shake the stars and he didn't so he's not real.&quot; More like, &quot;Ah, grandiose apocalyptic destruction. Yes I understand.&quot;  Let's do the last sentence, about angels, before the middle sentence about the Son of Man, from Mark 13. It's worth noting that &quot;angels&quot; can just mean &quot;messenger&quot;; in fact that is what angelous means. It doesn't necessarily imply a cosmic being like we're used to picturing. Thus, this is also easily explained: after 70 AD, Christians spread out and shared the gospel with an ever-growing part of the world, to the modern day. Which just leaves us with this: &quot;And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.&quot;</p>

<p>So let's look at this with honest eyes, as we should. It's nestled between two apocalyptic-literature descriptions of the siege of Jerusalem and following diaspora. Does it then follow, again if we are trying to analyze the text honestly, that this sentence, among its fore and aft context, must for some reason be interpreted with strict literalism? Of course not. Do I know precisely what it means? Not particularly. Is it necessary to have an exact interpretation? No, not really, given that it's easily established as symbolic. Once you see that it is symbolism, our ability to place a firm interpretation upon it in order to establish its veracity becomes moot. It could easily be referring to Christians (or anybody) at the time understanding God's power in predicting and executing this judgement upon Israel; and there'd be no real way to argue against that effectively. Stated bluntly, since it's reasonably established as symbolic, there's no real way to argue it wasn't fulfilled somehow and possibly just not written down in records that survived to be recorded and reach us. (I return to this down below, though.) Really these verses just represent the accurate and specific prophetic power of Christ, and that's that. There's no mention of the destruction of the world and all. Personally, I see much not all! of the Book of Revelation also applying to the destruction in 70 AD as well. It simply makes too much sense, and aligns too well. Silly attempts to make 666 literally equal some name are exactly that: silly. Numbers throughout the book are used in symbolic ways, so 666 should be treated no differently (e.g., perhaps it is symbolic of incompleteness, less than 777). Again, similar apocalyptic literature used in the Old Testament uses equally dire language, and equally expansive terminology, yet refers to a relatively local event. Revelation was also written around the right time, and John, its author, talks about the imminence of the described events. Further, the churches referenced were quite literal, nearby churches. Ironically, when these three are quoted, they leave out one I personally would think detractors would leap at; John 21:22, where Christ, responding to Peter who has just found out he's going to be martyred, says: &quot;Jesus said to him, 'If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!'&quot;</p>

<p>I've heard a few times people cite this one as evidence Christ was supposed to come back before John died, and then cite that John, of course, died before 100 AD. I'm fairly certain a poor reading of this difficulty is why the Mormons believe John is still walking around today (John even addresses that in this very chapter, in verse 23). But frankly, it's no difficulty to resolve it. Christ is actually saying &quot;If I wanted him to live until the end of time, what's that to you? What happens to him is none of your business.&quot; It's hyperbole to jog Peter. How do I know that? Because of the very misunderstanding referenced in Scripture and picked up by the Mormons. One must assume at the outset that Christ was going to return beyond the normal lifespan of a man if they thought Christ was saying John wouldn't die at all, ever. Otherwise, one would take it to mean John would not be martyred, not that he wouldn't die.  Which brings us to the end of the section on the Critical Triplet, yet another sad attack on Christianity perpetuated by those who don't even bother to read the book they hate for more than five seconds, except to cherry-pick verses they don't like or confirm their pre-conceived notions. Seriously, the Matthew and Luke verses are so easily dismissed as being unproblematic it's almost bothersome I had to write about them, and I wouldn't have, if I didn't have people arguing that these disprove Christianity all the time. But when I have challenged those detractors with the above, they can never more than fumble and make baseless claims in response.  There are two last thoughts for this section. One, an explanation for why we don't see obvious signs, miracles, or spiritual gifts anymore (hence this chapter also being called the &quot;non-miraculous now&quot;), and two, a final reminder about evil and God's promises. But to the first one. This could be problematic, right? &quot;Oh yeah ok so God did all that stuff two thousand years ago, or more! And then just stopped? Riiiiiight.&quot; Without an explicit reason for it, we may be caught by this. (Note that I am essentially calling anyone in the modern world who claims to have healing, prophetic, or other powers a charlatan or at best a cosmically deluded fool. Also, there's the massive problem that people who &quot;have spiritual gifts&quot; like this, don't even use them in the way they're supposed to be used. Tongues, for instance, has a specific standard, specific uses, specific conditions, and the examples, such as at Pentecost where the apostles spoke in other languages to the assembled crowd, look nothing like the foolishness we see on display today. But anyways, I digress. I'm arguing that these miracles, these gifts, are no longer part of the normative Christian experience.) It's important to remember that, really, miracles happened in three great swathes: with Moses, Elijah, and Christ and his Apostles. They always served a purpose: they established the credibility of the speaker, and identified them as speaking words directly from God. Acts 2:22: &quot;Fellow Israelites, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know.&quot;</p>

<p>Hebrews 2:3-4: &quot;This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him. God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.&quot;</p>

<p>If miracles are special markers of special (or specific) revelation, then it's quite easy to see that when the Apostles died, they ended, for there was no one left delivering special revelation. 1 Corinthians 13 has a lot to say on this, but the verses I want to narrow in on are these: &quot;Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears.&quot;</p>

<p>Now you may have something of a hint as to why I paired this with the dialogue about the Critical Triplet. It should come as no surprise that I'm going to say that once Christ's prophecy was fulfilled in roughly 70 AD, that was the completeness that was coming. Then, as the last Apostles died in the decades following 70 AD, that was it. The Church had been founded, it was spreading, it was structured, and it had all of God's guidance that it needed in the form of Scripture and the indwelling Holy Spirit. Since the verses from Corinthians tell us that the signs and wonders and gifts will end, and then the events of 70 AD happened and were a natural end point for those gifts&#8230; it only makes sense to say &quot;yep, that happened, and the gifts were no longer necessary.&quot; Jeremiah 3:15-16: &quot;And I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding. And when you have multiplied and been fruitful in the land, in those days, declares the Lord, they shall no more say, 'The ark of the covenant of the Lord.' It shall not come to mind or be remembered or missed; it shall not be made again.&quot;</p>

<p> Why have I quoted these verses from Jeremiah? Because God was there talking about a change from an obvious, physical symbol of his power to what we have now. Today, we have shepherds after his own heart, and no miracles. Then, they had shepherds after his own heart, and no ark.  But to reinforce the point, here are some verses from acts that clarify this, first Acts 1:8: &quot;But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.&quot;</p>

<p>Acts 2:17-18, quoting the prophet Joel: &quot;In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams. Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.&quot;</p>

<p>Note the connection there between 'last days' and last days in this verse of Hebrews, 1:2, which identifies what the 'last days' are; they're the days of his Son on earth: &quot;but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.&quot;</p>

<p> And one final set of verses to connect the 'last days' to the coming judgement of Jerusalem and Israel, James 5:1-9: &quot;Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you. &#8230; You have laid up treasure in the last days. &#8230; You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter. You have condemned and murdered the righteous person. He does not resist you. Be patient, therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. &#8230; Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand. Do not grumble against one another, brothers, so that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door.&quot;</p>

<p> We, or perhaps just I, see plainly that James is connecting the last days with the coming judgement of Israel in 70 AD. In fact, this really lends support to my previous interpretation that &quot;And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.&quot; is an apocalyptic metaphor for the destruction and woe visited upon Israel, for James himself connects the coming of the Lord with judgement. So it helps both my purposes.   &quot;Hold on just a minute,&quot; said one detractor reading all of the above. &quot;What about John 21:22? There's no mistaking that one! Christ meant he was coming back to see John, physically! That's the second coming!&quot; Here are the verses in question, John 21:22-24: &quot;When Peter saw him, he asked, 'Lord, what about him?' Jesus answered, 'If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.' Because of this, the rumor spread among the believers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, 'If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?' This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>If you recall, I previously discussed the date of authorship of John, albeit briefly while mentioning the four independent accounts of Christ's death, and this gospel was written after 70 AD. Considering the massive, blinding importance of Christ's physical return in &quot;clouds&quot; (Mark 13:26) and the like, John would not have neglected, if Christ did not come back, to leave this quote out or alter it. The better argument though is this, from John 14: &quot;I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.&quot;</p>

<p>As you see here, Christ explains what he means by &quot;come,&quot; and this reveals to us that &quot;come&quot; is not necessarily or exclusively the final coming of Christ in power and glory. So no, John 21 is not problematic. Far from it! John himself didn't see a glaring contradiction there. With that, I feel the case has been reasonably made that there was a definite purpose to miracles, that purpose was fulfilled at a non-arbitrary time, and they ended in due course, so there is no reason to expect more overt miracles and gifts in our time. And further, that many of the troublesome verses we see are readily explained by apocalyptic literary devices and a connection with the severe destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. Let's wrap this section up with 2 Peter 3:3-4: &quot;&#8230;knowing this first of all, that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing, following their own sinful desires. They will say, 'Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation.&quot;</p>

<p>We immediately see that even while Peter was alive, he predicted what the Church would be dealing with. See 2 Peter 3:9:  &quot;The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.&quot;</p>

<p> There's the Scriptural reason (one reason anyways) the Son hasn't come back yet; he's giving us a chance. He's being patient with us just like he was with Israel for nigh on millennia. So, there you have it, the last small piece of the &quot;non-miraculous now&quot; puzzle. With that, I'd call this part finished.</p>
