<h1>EVIL, SIN, AND GLORY</h1>

<p>Another lynching. Madness grips the South. A black man's hacked-off penis in his mouth, His broken body torched. The terrorized Blacks cower, and the whites are satanized. His students ask, in Carver's Bible class: Where is God now? What does He want from us?</p>

<p>Professor Carver smiles. &quot;God is right here. Don't lose contact with him. Don't yield to fear. Fear is the root of hate, and hate destroys  the hater. When Saul's army went to war against the Philistines, the Israelites lost contact, fearful of Goliath's might.</p>

<p>&quot;When we lose contact, we see only hate, only injustice, a giant so great its shadow blocks our sun. But David slew Goliath with the only things he knew&quot;</p>

<p>-Excerpt from &quot;Goliath&quot; by Marilyn Nelson, the theologically incorrect next stanzas left off; if Goliath is sin, his shade covering our head, fear creeping into our hearts&#8230; Scripture wants us to respond like David: he trusted that the Lord would do the right thing.</p>

<p>As I have gone through the glory narrative, I've ignored a wrinkle, or rather a canyon, that must be discussed. So, obviously, we sit in a world where we don't simply bask in the glory of the Lord, and do his will and draw closer to him all day. We sin, and we do it a lot. Sin: how does it factor into the glory narrative? Is sin glorious? Why does God allow it? Why didn't God prevent evil in the first place? What is sin in the first place? The list of questions goes on and on. The critical question has been reformulated over and over throughout the millennia, and is a chief reason many people abandon or do not take up the faith (well, so they say anyway). But I should not be too quick in assuming that everyone has the same idea of sin or evil as Scripture. Up first, then, is a brief overview of what exactly sin is to make sure we are using the same assumptions and working definition. Scripture simply defines sin in 1 John 3:4: &quot;Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.&quot;</p>

<p>That is, sin is rebellion. It is refusing to do God's will. R.C. Sproul, a late popular theologian, called it &quot;cosmic treason.&quot; This type of sin is fairly easy to grasp, but there is another, more contentious form of sin. See Psalm 51:5 for an introduction to original sin (the corruption caused by sin is often called iniquity in Scripture, more on that later): &quot;Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.&quot;</p>

<p>Original sin is a few things. The first I'll discuss is how it is a contamination of our very souls; it corrupts us from birth. To understand how we got infected by it, or rather how we infected ourselves with it, we have to go back to the Garden of Eden. The Garden was apparently a beautiful, harmonious place, and God put Adam and Eve in there to tend to it. They weren't mere working puppets, though, they were real thinking beings with independent wills, and God ordained that they would use them to make choices. One of the first choices Adam made was to name all the animals. (After all, what separates us from, say, a rock is chiefly that we have purposes and make choices.) God gave these thinking, willed beings one command: &quot;Don't eat from this specific tree.&quot; One tree, out of a forest of enticing trees, that was set apart. But, as the story goes, what did Adam and Eve do? They ate from that one tree. They used their God-given ability to make choices, to make a very poor one. That poor choice infected the world, and us, with what is called original sin. To see why, let's first look at Romans 5:12, with a sentiment echoed strongly in Isaiah 64:5-7: &quot; Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>Briefly, why death? Because God is a God of life, the owner and originator of all life, so life is his, and only his. That he gives it to us is not required, but a gift, and rebellion against him is a rebellion against life itself. Further, an omnipotent God has absolutely no reason to tolerate rebellion; it should burn up immediately in the face of his will. This means that he doubly has no reason to tolerate it, since it costs him nothing to remove it. This means that when we sin, we instantly deserve total destruction.  Back to the first sin. Rebellion came to us through Adam and Eve, and the world was forever altered by their decision. Let&rsquo;s not, though, allow Romans 5:12 to give us the wrong impression about &ldquo;inheriting&rdquo; that original sin, or what it is. My first impression of original sin was some black mark attaching it to my soul, and in my discussions with others, it seems that many forget we&rsquo;re the product of those who ate the fruit of that tree.  That tree was the tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. (Quite the mouthful!) Adam and Eve realized they were naked upon eating the fruit, so what did it do? It gave them an awareness, an ability to discern, that we had previously lacked; we had the ability to contemplate and make decisions about morality independent of God&rsquo;s decrees. As Adam&rsquo;s descendants, we have that awareness. You see, Psalm 119:73 and Leviticus 19:2-4 offers some insight. Mankind&rsquo;s image bearing responsibility is to reflect God from a personal perspective. The law, or God&rsquo;s commands in general, reflect his image from a morality-character-authority perspective. Our job is not to alter that perspective, for then we lie about who he is, and assume the Law&rsquo;s job. (Paul has tons to say about this in Romans and Galatians.) You may ask, &quot;Sure, we have the awareness and loss of innocence from the garden, but how are we responsible for the choice made by a man and a woman some many millennia ago?&quot; It makes little sense, so the argument goes, for us to be charged for the sin Adam committed that we did not. However, when we sin (not if, remember: Ephesians 2:3, Romans 3:23, among others, state that we have all sinned), we are thus charged the penalty of that inherited nature, and this is why: when we sin, we affirm the decision of Adam to eat the fruit. When we sin, we say &quot;I'm glad Adam gave me the power to discern good and evil so I can go and do evil.&quot; And because we affirm his decision, we are guilty of having done the exact same thing. In order for you and I to sin, Adam must have eaten from the tree. Since we willingly sin, we agree with his choice, we rely on it, and we affirm it. If someone breaks down a door and I go through, I affirm their decision to break down the door by making use of it, and I rely on it because I couldn't have gotten through otherwise. Isaiah 65:1-7 has something to say on this matter, but I have an entire special article, L, on inherited guilt. It covers liability for the sins of others in general, but more to the point, it serves to clarify the limits on this idea of approval of sin meriting liability for it. Essentially, you do not inherit the guilt of another for their sins. (There is of course much Scripture cited there to defend that assertion in L.) &ldquo;I was ready to be sought by those who did not ask for me; I was ready to be found by those who did not seek me. I said, 'Here I am, here I am,' to a nation that was not called by my name. &#8230; a people who provoke me to my face continually, &#8230; These are a smoke in my nostrils, a fire that burns all the day. Behold, it is written before me: 'I will not keep silent, but I will repay; I will indeed repay into their lap both your iniquities and your fathers' iniquities together, says the LORD; because they made offerings on the mountains and insulted me on the hills, I will measure into their lap payment for their former deeds.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>The quoted section details that God is always ready to forgive, but as successive generations fail to break from their sinful past, and learn from and follow suit of their forebears, they have made the sins of their parents&rsquo; their own, so they make the punishments of their parents&rsquo; their own as well. Accepting, willing receipt of sin entails accepting, willing receipt of punishment. Original sin is thus two things. It is the altered perception as a result of eating the fruit, and then it is the approving guilt of Adam's enabling rebellion. Again, it is not inherited guilt. It might be accepted guilt in any number of cases, but it is not unwilling acceptance. But there's also another more curious effect of 'original sin.' Again, God is the source of everything that is good. That means anything like mercy, or justice, or kindness, or love: those are all the sole right and item of God. When we rebelled against God, we lost the right to have any of him in us or around us.  So from the moment you are born, you are cut off from God's goodness. This makes some experiential sense to anyone who has raised a child; who ever had to teach a toddler to be selfish, to be angry, to lie? As Voddie Baucham humorously puts it, &quot;That's not a little angel, it's a viper in a diaper.&quot; Jokes aside, people in their current natural state would be able to express exactly zero of God's good qualities, since we have lost the right to them. This is the final component of original sin: we don't have the right to be good. Our sins, our evil and barbarity, hopelessness, anxiety, pain, anger: are all we deserve, all we can claim, because we have rejected God.  With sin described, and how we came to be sinful also described&#8230; what often happens is people nod when I say all that, then the immediate reply is &quot;well, that seems an awful lot like God's fault.&quot; To elaborate: &quot;Why did God make such defective creatures that rebelled basically instantly? Why didn't he delete us and start over? Actually, why didn't he just make us better in the first place?&quot; The answer to these questions will be the bulk of this chapter. Let&rsquo;s start with this: if God is omniscient, then he very well knew what was going to happen. It must, therefore, be the case that our rebellion aided God's goals (or had no effect on them). More specifically, his goal is his glory, he knew about our rebellion, and did things this way anyway: ergo, our rebellion must have enhanced his glory in some way. It&rsquo;s also possible that our rebellion was an unavoidable side effect of his true purpose, a possibility we will explore further down. Of course, our rebellion can&rsquo;t get in the way of an omnipotent God&rsquo;s ability to execute his designs. Moreso this: if he wanted a people to share himself with for his glory, why did he do it this way, a way that allowed for evil to exist?  How can we even evaluate an answer to these questions? As I&rsquo;ve stated, I&rsquo;m looking for character inconsistencies or contradictions in the Lord&rsquo;s actions, so that will be part of it. I'm looking to see if, in his handling of evil, God violates his character or goals. Simple enough, God is his own metric. Is this circular? &quot;Of course God would define his solution as perfect,&quot; you might say, but that is not the intention here. He&rsquo;s told us who he is, and shown us what he&rsquo;s done: is he trustworthy? Is he contradictory, and thus probably a human invention?  Enough contextual preamble. I do have to attack this problem from many angles, so bear with me. The first is figuring out whether wrath is glorious and whether God&rsquo;s perfect justice and perfect mercy are contradictory. In so doing we will explore God&rsquo;s chosen solution to the sin problem: Christ. This will not resolve all the questions about Adam and Eve outright, so more will follow. But let&rsquo;s start with wrath: if God's very self is glory, then all of his traits must be glorious, and that includes his wrath. Romans 9:22-23: &quot;What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>Ezekiel 28:22: &quot;&#8230;Thus says the Lord GOD: 'Behold, I am against you, O Sidon, and I will manifest my glory in your midst. And they shall know that I am the LORD when I execute judgments in her and manifest my holiness in her;&quot;</p>

<p>These two sections from Scripture show us that a trait we typically would not think of as 'glorious' in fact is, and that also God has specifically taken action in the past to glorify himself in his wrath. Pointedly, I hear this far, far too much: &ldquo;I do tend to prefer Christians who emphasize the &lsquo;loving&rsquo; side of the faith.&rdquo; I want to deal with this sentiment as well; my thesis is that God&rsquo;s wrath is to our benefit. I&rsquo;ll explain how as I go along. Much has been made of Romans 9:22-23 that we'll get to towards the end of this chapter, but suffice it to say that those who are not saved will still glorify God by bearing his wrath for their rebellion. Further, in the verse from Ezekiel above, we saw God specifically acting to stamp out rebellion and display his wrath for his glory's sake. Take a look a few verses later at Ezekiel 28:26 too: &quot;They [Israel] shall dwell securely, when I execute judgments upon all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God.&quot;</p>

<p>The Israelites were protected by God's wrath, and shown mercy for their own failings. We see this pattern of wrath for the rebel and mercy for the remnant all throughout Scripture. In the following verse, the prophet Isaiah relays God's words, and pairs wrath with patience again, like the Romans excerpt. Isaiah 48:8-11: &quot;&#8230;For I knew that you would surely deal treacherously, and that from before birth you were called a rebel. 'For my name's sake I defer my anger; for the sake of my praise I restrain it for you, that I may not cut you off. Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tried you in the furnace of affliction. For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it, for how should my name be profaned? My glory I will not give to another.&quot;</p>

<p>As you see, God's patience with us is for his glory too. Sure, that&rsquo;s easy enough to accept with Scripture backing it up: wrath is glorious, and God delays his wrath patiently. A new question appears: &ldquo;Are we playthings to be massacred for his glory, waiting in cells for the right time because he's patient with who and when?&rdquo; We&rsquo;re just getting started; I haven't tackled why God make Adam and Eve exactly as he did, or how that decision maximized his glory and was without contradiction. There is yet more work to be done. More questions come: What about mercy? Is mercy not at odds with justice (the justification of wrath)? That sounds a lot like a contradiction: how can we say that God is perfectly just and also perfectly merciful simultaneously? Here's a couple verses that mention his mercy: Psalm 25:11: &quot;For your name's sake, O LORD, pardon my guilt, for it is great.&quot;</p>

<p>Psalm 79:9: &quot;Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; deliver us, and atone for our sins, for your name's sake!&quot;</p>

<p>Psalm 130: &ldquo;Out of the depths I cry to you, O LORD! O Lord, hear my voice! Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my pleas for mercy! If you, O LORD, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? But with you there is forgiveness, that you may be feared. &#8230; O Israel, hope in the LORD! For with the LORD there is steadfast love, and with him is plentiful redemption. And he will redeem Israel from all their iniquities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If God wants to glory in both mercy and justice fully, two options come to mind after a little thought: One, God could just make wrath and mercy available to all, and some will naturally fall into either camp, so both get to be displayed. Or two, at times he maximizes his justice, and at times he maximizes his mercy, so in the end, both have been satisfied. Both of these are worse than what Scripture tells us he&rsquo;s done.  Christ was/is God&rsquo;s solution. So we're all on the same page with perhaps not this exact wording but the core ideas behind it, here's the gospel in an overly dry and specific run-on sentence: The gospel is the good news that God, in his sovereign grace, chose to save sinners by sending his Son, Jesus Christ, to live a perfect life, to die on a cross to save his people, and drink the cup of his wrath on our behalf so that we could be redeemed and reunited with God, to the glory of the Father.  In other words, in the offer of Christ, we find maximum mercy: Scripture tells us that salvation is a gift, a full pardon from endless punishment in hell. The gift, as well, is the indwelling Holy Spirit, Christ as head priest, Lord, and savior, and the Father as our head of household. Thus, the gift itself is also maximal: it is God. So through Christ we were spared the max, and undeservedly given the max.   In Christ, God actually satisfies his justice and mercy together. Christ bore God's wrath, fulfilling it. He also opens the way to God's mercy, fulfilling that as well. He bore the brunt of God's wrath and then he freely offered his mercy to us. The following three quotes defend this idea. I am going to start with Philippians 2:5-11, which shows that Christ is indeed for God's glory (NIV quote): &quot;&#8230;have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness &#8230; he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death&mdash; even death on a cross! Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name &#8230; and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&quot;</p>

<p>Ephesians 1:13-14 (NIV): &quot;And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession&mdash;to the praise of his glory.&quot;</p>

<p>John 13:31-32: &quot;When [Judas] had gone out, Jesus said, 'Now the Son of Man is glorified and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once. &#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>From drinking the cup of wrath to our full salvation, all of it was for God&rsquo;s glory. So, God knew what he was going to do about sin in advance, and that chosen solution was Christ. The Old Testament is littered with verses that show this. God knew it was the solution from even the time of Adam and Eve's sin, and the prophets foretold of it. (Genesis 3:15, Isaiah 53:5, Psalm 2:14&ndash;18, Zechariah 12:10, among others. I will discuss salvation in the Old Testament in a few pages, and prophecy later on in more detail.) So we know that it was not some slapdash thing he cooked up after man fell; God decided in advance that when man sinned, he would give up Christ to his wrath, part of his own self, in order to bring us back.  Let's see some excerpts from Scripture that discuss the Christ solution and I'll expand the argument. First is an excerpt from Romans 5 (NIV): &quot;Nor can the gift of God be compared with the result of one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification. For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!  Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people. For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.&quot;</p>

<p>Two key points: One man caused all this, and one man fixed it. No more was required to undo it. However, the reply comes: &quot;Why did God need to use one man? Why not zero?&quot; More or less, humans screwed up, so humans needed to pay for our sins. I already talked a bit about God's proclaimed perfect justice; he wouldn't not punish our sin, which is what the 'zero-man' solution argues for in essence. What's he going to punish instead? A stick? Obvious nonsense. &quot;A judgement vessel or doll made specifically to take his wrath!&quot; What do you think the human Christ is, o nay-sayer? No. Human sin, human punishment. An individual caused all these problems, and an individual solved them.  Second, the indwelling of God, the family association with God, the gift of God from God to us outweighs the fallenness of the world, so much so that the two can't be compared. Here's an excerpt from Romans 6 concerning Christ that promises that gift, using the surety of Christ's rise (NIV): &quot;Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin&mdash; because anyone who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.&quot;</p>

<p>That excerpt shows us in detail that we will be freed, completely, from the scourge of evil and sin. More or less this excerpt confirms what I had said: Christ is a solution to the problem of sin. 2nd Corinthians 5:17 offers this additional insight into this: &quot;Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.&quot;</p>

<p>This next one is Romans 5, it defends that Christ brought peace between us rebels and God, and this showed his love for us: &quot;Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us. You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. &#8230; But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him! For if, while we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!&quot;</p>

<p>There we see that we have been redeemed and reconciled by Christ's sacrifice. In Scripture, Christ often talked about having been here for peace; but not peace between men (or not only that), but peace between humanity and God. The indemnity between us and him was cosmic and maximal. Christ took it away (for those of his flock). The offer of salvation by grace through faith alone is the most merciful act of Scripture, those who deserve the least are given the most, and so to reiterate, we see God's mercy and love maximized through this act. Also in these verses is the notion that only someone who was blameless could possibly stand before God's wrath for us. It is an object of, and fulfillment of, God's perfect mercy and love that he allowed someone to stand in for us. That person had to be perfect, otherwise they could not pay for our sins, since no one can pay for their own sins and then someone else's: the penalty for any sin is death. You can only die once. 1 Peter 2:24 says: &quot;He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.&quot;</p>

<p>1 John 2:2: &quot;He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.&quot;</p>

<p>He bore the wrath intended for everyone (well, everyone who does not wind up in Hell, but we're getting there). Verses such as 1 John 3:2 and Romans 8:30 additionally show us the comprehensiveness of the Christ solution, and how it resolved the root causes of sin instead of being a mere salve. Our human, sinful nature will be abandoned, our wills conformed to that of God only when we transition from sinner and saint to just saint.  In sum, there is ample Scriptural evidence that through Christ, not only was the penalty for sin paid, satisfying God's perfect justice, but God's perfect mercy, or grace, was satisfied as well: we are all offered forgiveness. Further, Christ's resurrection, and our belief in it, brings the Holy Spirit into us, and we can therefore be conformed to the image of God anew. We were created to and did for a while live with God, but chose to disobey him. Now, the penalty for that disobedience has been paid, and with the indwelling Holy Spirit, we can live with God again, and we'll have chosen to, and want to. We can be the creation that chooses not to eat the fruit. By being made dead to sin, we are no longer married to it, slaves to it. By all of that, we can reasonably conclude that Christ is an effective, non-contradictory solution to the problem of sin.  &quot;Sure. But how exactly is that more efficient, or better, than just starting with creatures that wouldn't sin? Sure Christ satisfies God's justice and mercy and all that, but it doesn't feel better than the alternative of there being no sin in the first place.&quot; One thing I wish to note is that there is no need to discuss alternative solutions to the problem of sin; Christ fulfilled God&rsquo;s objectives perfectly and maximally &ndash; that means you can only ever equal the Christ solution, not exceed it. I will reiterate so we don&rsquo;t get lost or forget: by God&rsquo;s standard. That&rsquo;s the one we&rsquo;re checking this by.  &quot;Okay, fine, but I still don't understand why didn't God just make us with his Holy Spirit and all to begin with? Even if I grant that this is all neat and tidy, why not start there? It was within God's power. Surely he values the minimization of evil as well as the maximization of his glory.&quot;  Just about here is where you often start hearing about the phrase &ldquo;free will.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not about to repeat that tired and a-Scriptural claim that God valued free will more than preventing sin or bla bla bla, whatever variation you&rsquo;ve heard. Yet, clearly, God created a being with the capacity to disagree with him, to ignore him. God desires community, not a prison. Community goes both ways. Relationships go both ways. We find this all over Scripture, yes? God makes covenants with men. He made one in the garden, he made one with Noah, he made one with Abraham, he made one with Moses, he made one with David, and we have the New Covenant with Christ. Adam failed the test, God prevented total destruction with Noah, promised redemption through Abraham, established Israel through Moses, promised a perfect king with David, and fulfilled all of it in Christ. And each time, the human beings involved screwed it up. That is important. Keep that in your head. God made these covenants with us, and time and time again we could not and did not keep up our end. I am, of course, suggesting that human beings inevitably disobey. &ldquo;So why did he make humans or creatures that would inevitably disobey? How is it not his fault?&rdquo; The discussion has moved on, so a brief recap: wrath is glorious (part of God&rsquo;s character), justice and mercy can be fulfilled in a non-contradictory manner through Christ, who perfectly solves sin by God&rsquo;s metrics, and God is patient with us. Now, keeping the community aspect of God in mind, I&rsquo;ll tackle the inevitable disobedience of not only humans, but any creature with a distinct will from God&rsquo;s. This will be in service of answering the remaining questions about the existence of evil. Imagine some entity A, and some entity B. We can see plainly that if A and B have distinct wills, then they are not the same will, and there must be some difference. Thus, A and B will disagree at some point. Romans 7 says as much: the moment the law was shown to us, we sinned, because we are by nature rebellious. You may wish to read verses 7-14, but here's verse 7:8: &quot;For apart from the law, sin lies dead.&quot;</p>

<p>What are we to make of this? Paul is discussing in Romans 7, in part, whether God's law is evil or not (&quot;what then shall we say? That the law is sin?&quot;). God's commands, while good on their own, only reveal the sin that was already within us (hence, sin lies dead until the law reveals it and it springs into action). Might then God, in the Garden of Eden, have been doing the same thing? I&rsquo;ll come back to that, but I need to fully defend, from a Scriptural perspective, this idea that any being with a separate will, will inevitably disobey.  Let's see God's demonstrations of the problem in Exodus and Ezekiel. The Exodus, which in a lot of ways can be seen as a metaphor for humanity (despite it also being a literal event), can be summarized like this: 1. The Israelites wound up as slaves of the Egyptians, in a fallen state. 2. They lived in these conditions until Moses, an image of the savior to come, arose and rescued them from Pharaoh, who had oppressed them. 3. They left the fallen lands through the 'Sea of Reeds,' which is symbolic of baptism. 4. When they were nearing the Promised Land after a long time in the desert, the people grumbled, and Moses disobeyed God in a display of pride. He failed to complete the journey as a result, and failed to lead the people into the Promised Land. (This was God showing us that something greater was needed to finish the journey to the Promised Land.) The metaphor ends there, but you see the connection. Setting aside Moses' failure, we see that Moses is a stand-in for Christ, the Promised Land stands for heaven, and Egypt symbolizes the prison of sin or simply 'the world.' But what is my point in detailing all of that? Look first at Numbers 12:3 (NIV): &quot;Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.&quot;</p>

<p>Moses is the author of Numbers, and he said what he said in 12:3 with much the same sentiment as when Christ said this: &quot;Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?&quot;</p>

<p>Neither statement is prideful bragging: Moses is telling us that he was the most humble human, and Christ is telling us the scope of his value just as factually. Similarly, both had a reason to tell us these facts. I would like to focus on Moses'. Moses is saying, &quot;nothing recorded in this work or others I write is for my own aggrandizement but the Lord's glory.&rdquo; He was telling us that he had suppressed his will as much as could be done, and had the proper perspective on his relative worth to the Lord&rsquo;s as much as could be done. So, if there was ever a being with its own will, yet without Jesus, to be able to keep God's commands and not let his own pride get in the way and fall like Adam did, it would be Moses. So if all it took was full humility, then it could be done. Yet he failed. There was something else that was (nearly) unique about Moses: his radiant face. See here in Exodus 34:30-35 (NIV): &quot;When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him. &#8230; But whenever he entered the Lord's presence to speak with him, he removed the veil until he came out. And when he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded, they saw that his face was radiant.&quot;</p>

<p>You see, Moses was as full of the Glory of the Lord as any man ever was, such that his face shone. I probably needn't remind you that he was the conduit by which God struck Egypt with the plagues. So if we look at Moses, we see in him a man who: 1. Was the most humble person - ever  2. Already had a very high amount of divine presence within him</p>

<p>But as I noted in point four, Moses winds up acting very unhumble. In Numbers 20:10 (NIV): &quot;He and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock and Moses said to them, 'Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?'&quot;</p>

<p>Moses says we, not 'the Lord.' For context, Moses was angry with the Israelites for their complaining, and was giving them a lecture. He isn't saying this happily, he's mad, and the next thing he did was strike the rock to bring forth water. This is important, because God had told him to speak to the rock. But he hits it, twice, and that combined with the 'we' is enough for God: Moses is ascribing the production of the water to himself, not God. This was a shocking departure from his usual character of obedience and humility. This makes my point; the presence of the Lord within and a totally humble character are not enough; Moses&rsquo; will was separate from God&rsquo;s, and so it disagreed at some point. There is another being I want to talk about, though, that also fell from a position of immense honor. The high angel Lucifer. Let's look at Ezekiel 28 for information about Lucifer (NIV): &quot;This is what the Sovereign Lord says: 'You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God &#8230; You were anointed as a guardian cherub, for so I ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God; you walked among the fiery stones. You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created till wickedness was found in you. Through your widespread trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God, and I expelled you, guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones. Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to the earth &#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>I have cut out parts of the description, but from what's left here we see that Satan was an important being. He was made perfect. He was given wisdom and beauty. He had power, and was with God, perhaps directly in his presence like the seraphim of Isaiah's vision. Isaiah 14:13 may imply he wanted to glorify himself above God, but that section as a whole could merely be mocking the real human kings of Babylon who thought they were set on going to the heavens, and not intending to reference Satan. However, Isaiah's messages reach past current events to timeless truths, and what is true of the king of Assyria or Babylon or Egypt or England or even Satan&#8230; is true of all. But more importantly, Satan is given to us as an example of a creature made perfect, by any metric (albeit lower than God). Be it authority, power, wisdom, strength, beauty&#8230; he had it all. And he grew prideful, and betrayed God. Just like Moses, who had none of those things; and he grew prideful too.  The argument being drawn here is that Scripture says that there could be no being that would have lacked the capacity to disobey - pay attention to that phrase, I am being very specific in my phrasing - in the Garden of Eden, or anywhere really, eventually. It doesn't matter, then, in what form we cast a hypothetical being with an individuated will to put in the Garden of Eden. It will never be humbler than Moses. And he struck the rock. It will never have more honor or splendor than Satan, and he took a third of the angels with him.  So, when I wrote the above, I hadn't yet completed my study of Isaiah. Imagine my surprise, then, when I find God making the very same argument in Isaiah! Look to Chapter 5: &quot;My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill. He dug it and cleared it of stones, and planted it with choice vines; he built a watchtower in the midst of it, and hewed out a wine vat in it; and he looked for it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes. And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard. What more was there to do for my vineyard, that I have not done in it? When I looked for it to yield grapes, why did it yield wild grapes? &#8230; For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are his pleasant planting;&quot;</p>

<p>He says the same thing as me plain as day: there was nothing else to be done for the proverbial vineyard, and yet it still produced failure, and who was to blame? We see then that any creature given its own will, will inevitably disobey. The affairs of the human world alone, of all creation, fall out of order; the stars didn't muck about, plants were doing their thing, animals, fungi, insects, everything except us was quite orderly. But there's a challenge, that brings us to the next section. To recap, I&rsquo;ve argued that wrath is glorious, Christ solves sin perfectly and fulfills God&rsquo;s justice and mercy perfectly. Then I argued that any being with an independent will, must necessarily disagree with God&rsquo;s will. The challenge is this: &quot;Sure, but your argument seems to imply it's impossible at all. Clearly, through your Christ, it is not. So what's the difference, and why didn't God do it that way at the outset?&quot;  Let's consider God's nature: when he describes himself in Scripture, it is very often as a light; and what does light do? It radiates, it warms, it illuminates. In other words, it shares itself. So what did God want to do with us? He wanted to follow that nature; to share his glory and self. Indeed, in Scripture, we see a constant narrative of God running after us despite us running away from him. He follows us all the way from Adam to you and me, with many, many, many misfits and miscreants in-between. He loves us, but does not coerce love in response: he gives us a choice. I said it once I&rsquo;ll say it again: Scripture brooks no argument of free will, I make an argument of independent will. Further, I don&rsquo;t think God&rsquo;s sovereignty should be sidelined in favor of some precious will of ours. The apparent contradiction of responsibility and sovereignty is discussed later on. 1 John 5:3: &quot;In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands.&quot;</p>

<p>Programming that follows its instructions has no &quot;love.&quot; Thus, loving God requires choosing to do so, and given the verse, that means choosing to have trust him. At the restoration of Eden, we see this, Revelation 22:17: &quot;The Spirit and the bride say, &quot;Come!&quot; And let the one who hears say, &quot;Come!&quot; Let the one who is thirsty come; and let the one who wishes take the free gift of the water of life.&quot;</p>

<p>But one verse does not fully explain this. As I've stated, all of creation was made to point to its creator. We know this obviously since creation is for his glory, so it thus must typify him who made it. An exemplar is marriage. Marriage is a creation-example of the relationship God has with his people. In the prototypical perfect marriage, we find two people that chose one another, loving each other self-sacrificially till the end of their days, each carrying out their ordained role and loving one another with full joy.  Jeremiah 10:16: &quot;Not like these is he who is the portion of Jacob, for he is the one who formed all things, and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance; the LORD of hosts is his name.&quot;</p>

<p>God's use of Jacob instead of Israel is not accidental here; Jacob was a sinful, rebellious man. God saying that Israel was his inheritance (from creation), defends my argument as well. No part of this relationship, in fact, is accidental in design, and so I find in this an example of why God has set it up it so that we have a choice in the matter of who we marry. So in the garden, he had to give us a command, or else we couldn't willingly love him (by his own definition). Love is a choice, remember, and a choice requires an independent will (subtly different from a &quot;free&quot; will; nobody has a free will, for we are at the very least constrained by physics, memory, and God&rsquo;s sovereignty; and I'd rather not spend three pages bickering about what exactly &quot;free&quot; means). There are three components to a bona fide independent will: 1. Choices to make. Without choices to make, an independent will is, in practical terms, meaningless and unverifiable. 2. Awareness of the choice and belief in the idea that choosing is possible. If you don't know there are choices, or have no faith that you can actually make choices, then you do not have an independent will. 3. Consequences of choice. If your choices do not have consequences, have you actually made any choices? (I am using the word 'consequences' in its neutral form, meaning generic cause and effect.)</p>

<p>Using these components, what we see in the Garden of Eden immediately makes more sense. God wanted us to have a choice to love him or not (not for us, but for his glory and for his community), and love for him is following his commands. So he gave us a command: a single one about not eating from a tree (which was really a warning about trust &ndash; more on this in a moment). And then, he allowed the serpent to inform us that it was possible to distrust, and of course disobey, God. The serpent satisfies #2 above. And then, of course, the result of Adam's choice obviously fulfills #3. Why do I bother going through that? Because I want it to be clear: God did not do this. We did. Adam did. Eve did. For those of you who see that logic and go, &quot;That's very human centric. Didn't you warn us that Scripture is always God focused?&quot; Very sharp of you! That is correct. Similarly, if you watch John MacArthur's video sermon entitled &quot;John MacArthur: Why Does God Allow So Much Suffering and Evil?&quot; you're going to find him saying something, after 45 minutes (seriously, skip to minute 45 if you watch the video, you'll have missed nothing), about this. He says something like &quot;The sovereign God cares about man's free will? Really?&quot; So let's think about this: Scripture can be looked at as a series of covenants between man and God, and so one can rightly see the situation in Genesis as the very first covenant between man and God. In order to make a covenant, one needs something to be agreed upon. Said another way, both parties make promises, both parties must be aware of their own and the other's promises, and consequences for violating or keeping the covenant (and dual awareness of those consequences). From this covenant perspective, we see the exact same criteria as I gave above. God is relational. He is communal. He values that, as one of his traits (three persons in one). Like I said with marriage, it points back to him. It in no way invalidates his sovereignty, or makes it not the focus. God is on his throne, God was on the cross, and God washed the feet of his disciples. God is all of those things. He can be the perfect servant and he can be the perfect sovereign.  Let&rsquo;s see again the trees God chose to name in the Garden, and return to my thought that &ldquo;Was God revealing the sin inherent within us by the trees in the Garden?&rdquo; from a few pages back. That first tree also did something else, see Romans 3:20: &quot;For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.&quot;</p>

<p>By it, God showed us what was right and what was wrong. Trusting him was right, disobeying him was wrong; choosing our own understanding over his was wrong. This is only a couple sentences in this book, but I must say that it is a very important point. God showed us the danger of not following him with this tree. Again, very important, and something I hope you remember about this tree. It was Satan that took that warning and twisted it into sin for our destruction. Of course, I answered why Satan was in the garden a few paragraphs back (part of the checks for an individual will).  The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil was, of course, the symbol of the test. (This is the only way in which these trees are metaphorical, is their existence as physical stand-ins for the Adamic covenant.) For Scriptural confirmation of such, see again in Revelation 22 (which re-confirms what I said about all of goodness being God&rsquo;s right to give, and those who forsake him losing right to it): &quot;'Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me, to repay each one for what he has done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end. Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates. Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.&quot;</p>

<p>Revelation 2:7 says the same thing. If Adam obeyed, if Adam passed the test offered by the first tree, the second, the Tree of Life, stood as a symbol of the promises of the covenant between him and God. Now, who do you suppose is the Tree of Life? Maybe an odd question to hear for the first time. But if you've ever opened a Bible you can probably guess: Christ, of course.  When we look at what happened in Eden, we say &quot;Look at what suffering and pain was caused!&quot; This is where the blame-game starts, in my experience, which I find immensely ironic, considering that is precisely what Adam and Eve did. Look at this (from Genesis 3):  The man said, 'The woman you put here with me&mdash;she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.' The woman said, 'The serpent deceived me, and I ate.'&quot;</p>

<p>I have argued with so many people who blame God for Eden, and it would be funny were it not so tragic. Adam blamed the woman and God in the first words of his statement. Eve blamed the serpent in the first words of hers. They blame absolutely everyone but themselves, and people continue on in that fashion, even today: blaming God in the first words off their tongues. There's no blaming it on God. The tree was in the center of the garden: no randomly happening upon it and eating it. The command was clear: no misinterpreting it. The garden was filled with trees that had tasty fruit, not like it was the only water in the desert. What excuse is there? As much as they want to blame God for giving us the choice, he really made it easy to not disobey. So we come to it: Scripture says God is sovereign and also that man is responsible for his evil. Isaiah 3:13-15:  &quot;The LORD has taken his place to contend; he stands to judge peoples. The LORD will enter into judgment with the elders and princes of his people: 'It is you who have devoured the vineyard, the spoil of the poor is in your houses. What do you mean by crushing my people, by grinding the face of the poor?' declares the Lord GOD of hosts.&quot;</p>

<p>Scripture seems to take the view that for any good to occur, God must act (which makes sense), and for evil to occur, God need do nothing at all (with regard to human action). Philippians 2:12-13 confirms this for us: &quot;Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p>I mean that's the whole point of what I argued above about the inevitability of disobedience, yeah? But I don&rsquo;t want to lose my way, here: the chief question at hand is &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t God shackle us at the beginning&rdquo; and &ldquo;does God care about our will?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m walking you briefly through covenantal theology to make a few points in regards to these questions. I'm going to drop this section from Galatians in here, Galatians 3:15-22: &quot;To give a human example, brothers: even with a man-made covenant, no one annuls it or adds to it once it has been ratified. Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, 'And to offsprings,' referring to many, but referring to one, 'And to your offspring,' who is Christ. This is what I mean: the law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void. For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise. Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made, and it was put in place through angels by an intermediary. Now an intermediary implies more than one, but God is one. Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law. But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.&quot;</p>

<p>There's so much of theological importance in that section that you could write a whole book about it probably, but I want to draw out a few things. God, speaking through Paul, declares that commands themselves cannot produce life; this is his answer to the objection: &quot;Why didn't God shackle us so we couldn't sin?&quot; Adam had one freaking command and got it wrong. The thing is, though, with these covenants, there's two sides every time, yes? God always wants us to participate. He values our participation, he wants us to want to be involved, and to work with him. God wanted us to choose to love him because it meant sharing in his glory and having eternal life and joy. But also from the Galatians excerpt: given that God seems to have arrived at the conclusion that any being with an individuated will inevitably disobeys, he decided that he must make a covenant with himself, and take up both sides of it on his own (graciously). We, then, get to partake of the fruit of that covenant by being washed by Christ's blood and relying on his righteousness, through faith in God. Through trusting God and being obedient, both of which Adam failed to do but Christ succeeded at. Now, the next question had to do with being &ldquo;human-centric.&rdquo; Here, see this, Psalm 119:58 (Motyer-modified ESV): &ldquo;I entreat your favor with all my heart; be gracious to me according to your word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you render that first part literally, it says &ldquo;I have mollified/softened your face&rdquo; &ndash; this is quite the daring expression, to say that we predisposed God to favor us; but the next part corrects any misinterpretation by the immediate reference to grace. The dynamic of prayer reveals how sovereignty and responsibility interact: he ordained certain graces to be dispensed by prayer, much how he ordained the choice of faith to be made properly by those who he wrote in the book of life.  I haven&rsquo;t bonded these two questions, &ldquo;Is that human-centric&rdquo; and &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t he shackle us?&rdquo; haphazardly. In the Psalms, and other books of course, but in the Psalms there are many references to God&rsquo;s distaste for empty ritualism. Often it is spoken that God has no love for sacrifices and burnt offerings given without proper heart intention. Yes I am about to make a Spongebob reference, because I grew up watching it. In one episode, the titular Spongebob is competing against his friend Patrick, at his boss, Mr. Krabs&rsquo;, behest. He has true passion and ardor for the profession of fry cook. When challenged to go forth and succeed, he yells &ldquo;For the Krusty Krab!&rdquo; Patrick, meanwhile, yells &ldquo;Because you told me to!&rdquo; (referring to Plankton, Krabs&rsquo; adversary.) And all the children laugh, because it is obviously ridiculous that &ldquo;Because you told me to!&rdquo; is a good reason to participate in something when compared to true devotion. So no, God had no intention of shackling us to his purpose, because that is not as valuable to him as the real deal. Again, he relates to us in a personal way, in a communal way. We are distinct from the rest of creation in this manner. Does God care about not violating our will? Of course not, he is sovereign, he laughs at the plans of the nations. But he certainly values our genuine devotion moreso than the alternative. You see the difference in perspective? The incorrect way of looking at this highlights man&rsquo;s preciousness, the other highlights God&rsquo;s position as the ultimate object of worth and the only measure. And, of course, while he values our uniqueness (as distinct human individuals, plus &lsquo;or else there would&rsquo;ve only been one human&rsquo;), he won&rsquo;t have in his community (at the end) anybody who isn&rsquo;t like him. That is why this argument is not human-centric in the slightest. It is all about what God values. To recap: Is anything I&rsquo;ve said human-centric? Nope. It&rsquo;s based on God&rsquo;s value system and has him as the focal point. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t God shackle us at the beginning&rdquo; is answered partly by the fact that he values genuine devotion over empty ritualism. So we must recast the question: &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t God solve the problem of evil when it arose or before it arose?&rdquo;  Really, all the opponent has here is: &quot;God let them Adam and Eve screw up and then didn't fix the problem as fast as I would like, or as I would think he should.&quot; Which brings us to the fact that God did in fact solve the problem immediately. We see signs of Christ even in Genesis 3, and the true form of salvation from sin was always available (indeed even in the Garden, trust was the rent due for peace with God). There was, of course, a delay between the Fall and Christ's name and life specifically revealed, and Scripture acknowledges it. Verses such as Hebrews 11:13 reveal this to us: &quot;These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.&quot;</p>

<p>Hebrews 3:16-19 back us into it, revealing that it has always been unbelief, a lack of trust in God and much trust in ourselves, that has denied us a relationship with the Father: &quot;For who were those who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses? And with whom was he provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient? So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.&quot;</p>

<p>You see, throughout the Old Testament, prior to Christ, there were still individuals who were saved, yes? Who as Scripture states, were not saved through the law, but by faith. See these verses from Galatians 3: &quot;Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? Did you suffer so many things in vain&mdash;if indeed it was in vain? Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith &#8230; Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. &#8230; So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.&quot;</p>

<p>Christ also, in John 3 when talking with a teacher of the law, chastised him for not knowing about things like &quot;Hey you need the indwelling Holy Spirit and to have a new spirit created within you.&quot; Faith has always been there. Before Christ was revealed, of course, there was a general messianic hope, Isaiah called him the &quot;Servant,&quot; and he shows up all over the place in the Old Testament. Here are a few verses that show us that the way to be saved has always been the same: Psalm 51:10-11: &quot;Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from me.&quot;</p>

<p>Psalm 87:5-6: &quot;And of Zion it shall be said, 'This one and that one were born in her'; for the Most High himself will establish her. The Lord records as he registers the peoples, 'This one was born there.'&quot;</p>

<p>Nehemiah 9:20: &quot;You gave your good Spirit to instruct them and did not withhold your manna from their mouth and gave them water for their thirst.&quot;</p>

<p>Isaiah 32:15-17, (which comes right after a proclamation of judgement and total destruction due to sin and rebellion): &quot;until the Spirit is poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field,  and the fruitful field is deemed a forest. Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness abide in the fruitful field. And the effect of righteousness will be peace, and the result of righteousness, quietness and trust forever.&quot;</p>

<p>Look at these verses from the end of Psalm 2 wrapping around into the beginning of Psalm 1: &quot;The LORD said to me, 'You are my Son; today I have begotten you. &#8230; Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him. &#8230; Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; but his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree [trans]planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. The wicked are not so&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>This is the gospel. I have added [trans]planted is because the Hebrew verb shathal means to transplant. It is talking about a new position for the tree. Another critical note in the Hebrew is that walk stand sit are perfect tense, meaning fixed: walking is habitual lifestyle, standing is to be noted or counted among, sitting is to be associated with. The blessed man mentioned at the end of Psalm 2 has, by kissing the Son, found his life changed, and he is not and will not be among the wicked in any sense. It describes a tree next to living water that yields fruit; this is a person who is of Christ (kiss the Son), sustained by the Holy Spirit (transplanted by streams of water) and produces a harvest of righteousness (that yields fruit), exactly like how we describe a modern Christian. I am tired of hearing about this, that the Old Testament is works-based or something, or there&rsquo;s no talk of salvation by faith in God alone, all of this, so you will have to indulge me. Here&rsquo;s yet more verses from Psalms. I want you to be like me: when someone says these things, I laugh. These quotes are not all full-ESV, some are modified to be more literal. Psalm 42:11: &ldquo;Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, [lit:] the salvation of my face and my God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Psalm 34:4-7: (Who, pray tell, is the angel of the Lord? Christ, of course, in his full divinity in the Old Testament.) &ldquo;I sought the LORD, and he answered me and delivered me from all my fears. Those who look to him are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed. This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him and saved him out of all his troubles. The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Psalm 37:34: &ldquo;Wait for the LORD and keep his way, and he will exalt you to inherit the land; you will look on when the wicked are cut off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Psalms 38-40 are something a Christian will be very familiar with. It follows the pattern of Sin&#61664;Wrath&#61664;Confession&#61664;Patience and Faith&#61664;Deliverance. (38:3, 38:5, 38:18, 39:7, 40:7-10.) Psalm 44 asks why enmity between man and God exists no matter what we do. Look here, 17-23: &ldquo;All this has come upon us, though we have not forgotten you, and we have not been false to your covenant. Our heart has not turned back, nor have our steps departed from your way; yet you have broken us in the place of jackals and covered us with the shadow of death. If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god, would not God discover this? For he knows the secrets of the heart. Yet for your sake we are killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered. Awake! Why are you sleeping, O Lord? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then what Psalm comes after that one? Psalm 45. Psalm 45 is about a wedding between a King, no, the King, and his bride. What follows Psalm 44&rsquo;s declaration that peace between man and God can&rsquo;t be achieved by man, that peace is revealed as being true and present in Psalm 45. Verses 6-7 call this King God, but also say &ldquo;God, your God.&rdquo; Imagine being an Old Testament believer and reading these words. The messiah is God, but also has Yahweh as his God? How can this be? Revelation had not caught up yet to be as clear as today. But other Scripture available told them that the Messiah would be a human (&lsquo;root of Jesse&rsquo;, the following son of David, etc.). Someone who put in the time would have been able to understand that the Messiah would be a God-man. Now, I imagine few had the pure intellect or put in the time necessary to fully comprehend such (rather, had the God-given means and motivation to do it). Blessed are we for whom the truth is plain. I mean, look at this. Psalm 49:7-9, 15 (Alec Motyer&rsquo;s literal direct translation, these words are important and the ESV screws it up): &ldquo;not one will in any way whatsoever ransom even a brother, nor give to God an atonement-price for him: the ransom of their soul is a costly matter, and one must give it up for ever, that he might live on in perpetuity, not see the pit. &#8230; Surely, however, God will himself ransom my soul from the hand of Sheol because he will take me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know. How many more times do I need to show it? Can someone still be unconvinced that salvation has always been the same? That the promise given and the promise kept are from the same God acting across time for his people? I don&rsquo;t know, so here&rsquo;s a few more.</p>

<p>Habakkuk 2:4: &quot;Behold, his soul is puffed up; it is not upright within him, but the righteous shall live by his faith.&quot; (Note that yichyeh does not refer only to 'present living' in the sense of 'this is a principle he lived by', but more broadly.)</p>

<p>Joel 2:28-29 &amp; 32 mentions the Holy Spirit, and is quoted in Acts 2:17-18; so while forward looking, I feel it is still applicable: &quot;'And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions. Even on the male and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit. &#8230; And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;</p>

<p>There are others, such as verses in Jeremiah 31 (9-11 but more relevantly 31 onwards refer to the New Covenant), Ezekiel 11 (14-21, but specifically 19), Deuteronomy 30 (1-9, specifically 6 reference the action of God, not man)&#8230; you get the idea. One finds ample acknowledgement that the Holy Spirit is acting in the Old Testament, and will act in the future, and that salvation is from the Lord and by the Lord. As a thought experiment, let's look at this testimony: &quot;I was a slave in a foreign land, doomed to die there. Then the great mediator came to me from God with a promise of deliverance. I trusted God's promise, and when destruction came, I was saved by the blood of the lamb. Then I, we, all of his people, were led away from the foreign land, led away from death, by him. Now, I walk the path to the Promised Land, still led by the mediator. Though I stumble, he will not let me fall, he will make sure I get there if I trust God.&quot; Who is speaking? A Christian today, or an Ancient Israelite who survived the Exodus? Both, nearly word for word it's the same, with certain exceptions like the true mediator has been revealed in Christ. Salvation, truth, they have not changed. The way in which you are rescued permanently from evil has not changed, even from the time of the garden. All Adam and Eve had to do was trust God. The answer has never changed: trust God over yourself. It is just that because of the Fall, our flesh has been infected by evil, so we are slaves to it and cannot hope to resist without the indwelling Holy Spirit. When the day of the Lord comes, everything will be made permanent, concrete. But it has always been there for mankind to take (rather, be given).  You can follow the gospel from now backwards to Bernard of Clairvaux, Anselm, Augustine of Hippo, Origen, to the letters of the New Testament, to Isaiah, Exodus, and beyond. &quot;Don't you remember?&quot; exhorted Paul. &quot;Haven't you read?&quot; exhorted Christ. It goes all the way back. What's my point? My point is that we misunderstand and forget today, they misunderstood and forgot then, but it's always been there: you can trace the gospel from right now all the way back to Adam. Anyways, let's look at an example in Isaiah 15-16, an oracle concerning Moab. Moab was a gentile nation that had often had&#8230; tense relations with Israel, and I can summarize this no better than Alec Motyer in his commentary on Isaiah: &quot;&#8230;Isaiah lifts a certain tract of history on to a new level: a Gentile people is in dire straits (15:1-9) and turns to Zion for help (16:1-4a); it hears the reply that the time of aggression is temporary but the throne of David is permanent (16:4b-5), an implicit invitation to find security by coming under the governance of Zion and the shadow of the Davidic king; Moab, however, cannot bear to lose face in this way; pride inhibits responding even to such good news (16:6), and in consequence Moab's sorrows continue (16:7-11); there is no other refuge (16:12), and only destruction awaits (16:13). Isaiah's purpose is &#8230; to use history to depict truth: the needy can find salvation by identifying with the people of God and coming within the embrace of his promises, but pride is a killer.&quot;  Again, with our individuated wills, we choose our own way over his, but as I have said, he comes to us over and over to show us the way out. That is why I find the &quot;he didn't fix it as fast as I would like&quot; to be again placing the blame where it does not belong. Men do evil, men reject God. We endure the fruits of their failings and our own.  &quot;Okay sure, so there's always been a solution,&quot; you say, &quot;but then why, if God knew we would sin, and hates evil, would he put the tree there? He knew this would lead to evil. He allowed evil to exist.&quot; I&rsquo;ve discussed why the trees were there at length, but this phrasing of the question brings us directly to the existence of evil. As part of the discussion, I will use three axioms that get tossed around about God: 1. If God is unable to prevent evil, then he is not omnipotent. 2. If God is not willing to prevent evil, then he is not perfectly good. 3. If God is both willing and able to prevent evil, then why does evil exist? Number 1 is easy to dismiss, biblically; God has demonstrably prevented and/or defeated evil of all orders; up to the ultimate evil, Satan. The Bible makes no claims that God is unable to prevent evil; so attacking it along these lines is fruitless. Numbers 2 and 3 are where we get into actually interesting questions. Number 2's inherent flaw is rather subtle, but the flaw lies in the assumption that the total prevention of evil is the ultimate good. The person who makes this argument is essentially saying that &quot;there being zero evil must mean there is only good, which is perfect goodness.&quot; But is it? You cannot prove that; this only guarantees that you only have good, or if you want to allow for trinary judgement, only good and 'neutral'. It does not guarantee that you have maximum or perfect goodness. You could easily have a world with the presence of some evil, that has more overall good, no? (If I like red flowers, and I have an infinite expanse of flowers, some of which are red and some of which are blue, do those blue ones detract from the red ones? No.) Which means one cannot claim that if God is unwilling to prevent all evil he is not perfectly good, since you cannot prove that the total lack of evil is equivalent to the maximum or perfect good. Second, merely lacking evil does not produce good per God's definition of it, or render the amount that is there maximal or perfect. Which is broadly the failure of Number 3. It assumes that: 1. God must act on our preferred schedule, i.e. that acting as soon as possible will result in the perfect/maximal good.  2. It fails the same way as number 2, with the assumption that a total lack of evil is equivalent to the perfect or maximal good. Again, this cannot be demonstrated, and the premise falls flat. God, throughout Scripture, demonstrates the inherent falsehood of these arguments. He uses evil for good constantly. He uses horrible people to effect great goods in the world. Indeed, he uses the torture and murder of his Son for the greatest good of all.  So we see that God will tolerate the existence of evil in order to bring about a greater good through it. An example of him doing such can be found in Genesis 50:20: &quot;You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, his justice demands that sin and evil be destroyed in the future, and they will be; just not on our time schedule. The book of Habakkuk details God using the Babylonians, in their great evil, to exercise his justice. Isaiah discusses conquerors being used to liberate Israel herself. So God too uses our suffering for good. For a more in-depth discussion of this, including an example using Genesis 15:16, see Special Article O. Thus we find that the question of evil has been reduced to this: &quot;I want evil to all be removed when I want it done.&quot; And to me, that is not enough to eliminate God as plausible, that he will remove evil on a different schedule than the one I would prefer. Such is the prerogative of an omniscient God. It's a human conceit to assume that if there were a God, he would agree with us about everything.  The final answer is thus that God wanted us to willingly love him, to willingly choose his offered gift of eternal life and joy. But, he knew not all of us would accept it and by nature we would rebel, and so he decided to use the evil we would cause to bring about an even greater good in the end and save those he wished to save. Rebellion was inevitable, but he offered us guidance on what was right and what was wrong. We rejected that guidance, and God already had something in place to bring us out of that rebellion. This I think is the principal counter to the &quot;superior created being&quot; or &quot;no tree&quot; arguments: we cannot guarantee that a world without any evil would be more perfect or have the maximum amount of good in it. If God can use the existence of evil for an even greater good, to further his goals, then the existence of evil does not invalidate God and we have our answer. Now, the section used to end there. But then I had a wonderful discussion with an atheist counterpart of mine, whereby he examined my arguments and came back with refutations. The first thing he said was: &quot;I'm willing to grant that some evil can be used to make the world a better place. But that does not account for all the evil in the world: there exists unnecessary evil. And so long as there is unnecessary evil in the world, the problem stands.&quot; That is, of course, predicated upon this statement, which is quite agreeable: Between two otherwise equivalent systems, the one that only has the necessary or useful evil in it is superior. Now, I could always resort to saying &quot;prove that there exists an unnecessary evil,&quot; but that&#8230; doesn't seem right, now does it? It feels slimy, it feels shady. I don't like relying on that, but thankfully Christians don't have to. Instead, let's start with: &quot;how are we defining evil?&quot; I have been over this, but again, in Scripture, the only intrinsic evil is, of course, deviation from God's commands. Evil is thus sin, which is rebellion against God. (Sometimes people try to use another definition of evil when debating me, and I simply shrug and say &quot;No clue. Ask someone who isn't a Christian and uses that definition of evil.&quot; Of course, much if not most of what we commonly call evil is sin. But definitions matter.) Only sin is inherently, intrinsically evil. &quot;But what about needless suffering? How can your God claim to be loving if there is needless suffering?&quot; comes the reply. Now, God plans to eliminate suffering for his people (note very, very clearly that I said &quot;his people&quot;), Revelation 21:4: &quot;'He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death' or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.&quot;</p>

<p>The reply is: &quot;Ok, so you're going to argue that he'll end it on his schedule, and we have no right to complain. But God shouldn't let us suffer regardless.&quot; There's two, no, three biblical responses to this. First from Psalm 50:16-23: &quot;But to the wicked God says: 'What right have you to recite my statutes or take my covenant on your lips? For you hate discipline, and you cast my words behind you. If you see a thief, you are pleased with him, and you keep company with adulterers. 'You give your mouth free rein for evil, and your tongue frames deceit. You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son. These things you have done, and I have been silent; you thought that I was one like yourself. But now I rebuke you and lay the charge before you. 'Mark this, then, you who forget God, lest I tear you apart, and there be none to deliver! The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me; to one who orders his way rightly I will show the salvation of God!'&quot;</p>

<p>Psalm 2:1-6 shows us God's perspective even more: &quot;Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and against his Anointed, saying, 'Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us.' He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision. Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying, 'As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill.'&quot;</p>

<p>Now, these verses aren't directly related to our suffering. But they do show us that from God's perspective, all the nations and all the people, so, everybody who isn't God's, is in active, conscious, thoughtful, conniving, jealous rebellion against him. And he's not bothered by that. What can man do to his plans? There's a certain sense of our rebellion simply does not matter, he will accomplish his purposes. And if by choosing to be his enemies we suffer for it, we make our children for it, that's not his fault. We chose rebellion. We are evil, at our core, and cannot lay claim to his justice or mercy for we reject and rejected them. The book of Job seems aimed directly at this too. In it, God says this: &quot;Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me.&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, the Scriptural response to the issue of suffering is, &quot;I don't owe you anything, not comfort, not water.&quot; And it's true. God doesn't owe us anything. How could that be the case given our sin (it was revealed Job, thought thinking himself sinless, harbored great pride in his heart)? But the argument continues, with: &quot;I don't like how your God does things, letting children get brain cancer is disgusting. Even if it isn't evil by his standards, he knows it's not right or else it would happen in heaven too and it won't.&quot; Is &quot;needless&quot; suffering evil (if I grant, for the sake of argument, that there is such a thing)? Is it unloving? Is it unjust? These are the questions that matter. Obviously if we simply don't like how God does things that doesn't invalidate his existence, but the answers to these questions could render him contradictory or duplicitous, and we need to figure it out. If God does not owe us comfort, then we really don't have a right to complain about it. Does he owe me a body without migraines, seizures, the rest? No. Did he owe me a childhood free of my tyrannical father and subsequent worse stepfather? No. Does he even owe me the right to exist? Of course not. Here&rsquo;s another variant: Did I do anything in particular to earn those experiences in particular? See Luke 13:1-5: &quot;There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. And he answered them, 'Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered in this way? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them: do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.'&quot;   Note, I'm writing this knowing at least one survivor of repeated childhood sexual assaults is going to read it, who I know personally. I don't know who you, dear reader, are specifically, but I'm asking you to approach this rationally. Nobody likes pain. I'm not sitting here having never seen or heard or felt anguish telling you some crap about philosophy that won't survive first contact with the street outside. But what I am doing is putting the emotional recoil aside and thinking clearly about this issue, and I expect the same of you. (You may find my wording dramatic, but I have had too many conversations where the other person could not escape emotion.) The majesty of Scripture is that it hides nothing of the human experience, a man trudging through the war-torn countryside of his country, a daughter abandoned for a belt and needle&#8230; all of us can find reflected in its pages what we've seen.  But I should summarize what I said above before continuing. God only defines evil as rebellion against him. That includes much of what we call evil, and there are many instances in Scripture where he acts against and is infuriated by evil acts of men. God does not owe us rebels comfort. He doesn&rsquo;t owe anybody comfort, but especially not comfort. That is one component of the answer to the &lsquo;problem of suffering.&rsquo; Isaiah 54:10: &quot;For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from you, and my covenant of peace shall not be removed,' says the LORD, who has compassion on you.&quot;</p>

<p>With that said, here's the frame of the issue about whether &quot;needless&quot; suffering is evil: &quot;My version of the ideal God is better than the real God because he would end all suffering immediately.&quot; If someone stopped all suffering right now, would they be morally superior to my God?  Again, we have no right to God's goodness due to our sin. We only have a right to, well, die before we finish blinking and be summarily kicked out of creation and off into hell. But that's not a full answer to the &quot;Morally Superior Stopper of Suffering&quot; challenge. What's that acronymize to? MSSOF? Sure. We can't say suffering disproves God, though, because it doesn't necessarily mean the world we're in isn't the best for producing good according to God's definition of good, and its existence does not cause a contradiction in his character or goals. Mind, if God is omnipotent and omniscient, it stands to reason any world he made would be the one that optimally advances his goals. If you can prove the world does not do that, then it is unlikely we're in a world made by God. (It's what the three axioms challenge I gave above is really driving at.) Humans sinned, and since sin is rebellion against an omnipotent God, he has no reason to tolerate it. So, death entered creation as a result. Environmental suffering, thus, could be called the 'birth pangs of death.' Given that the punishment we have earned for our sins is Hell, any suffering inflicted upon us in this world would in fact be justified, as in, an extension of God's justice and consequences for our sin. Since we are owed the misery of Hell, any misery we encounter here that is less than or equal to Hell is not unjust, and is in fact good since it is just. Any kindness beyond the eternal suffering in Hell we've earned is mercy borne of grace, which we have not earned, so saying it's unjust for one person or another to not receive that mercy doesn't hold water. You have to flip the thinking on its head; the perspective &quot;All suffering should stop,&quot; should instead be &quot;It's a wonder there's any mercy at all.&quot;  Let me say that unmistakably: you should be in Hell, so the fact that you aren't means God is being patient and merciful. I should be in Hell, so when I get a migraine or a seizure or have another kidney stone, I have absolutely no right to say &quot;Curse you God for this suffering! The MSSOF wouldn't've given me this migraine!&quot;  It occurs to me that if you've never been told that before, it might feel a bit like I just punched you. People who have endured more than I can claim to, or are currently, and anybody else, probably aren't going to get a whole lot of love out of that statement. But this is the logic Jesus used, see Matthew 10:28-31: &quot;And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.&quot;</p>

<p>Scripture points us to the proper eternal perspective, but also tells us God has us in his eye and hands. You and I and anybody else are not supposed to act like evil isn't evil and is somehow good. It's simply not unjust that we endure it. When Christ discussed the slaughter of the Galileans or the tower in Siloam falling, he didn't do that. He said &quot;Yep, sucks, and worse'll happen to you if you don't escape evil.&quot; That eternal perspective is absolutely necessary. I imagine it won't strike home to people who don't believe God is real, but again, I'm after his consistency contingent upon Scripture being correct. A child with brain cancer is abhorrent to us, and rightly so. But it has no invalidating power over whether God exists or not when you get down to it. Let me paraphrase a reply I got to the above: &quot;If anything this sounds more like a tyrannical and evil god being explained away. Damning an entire species, even or perhaps especially one you created, is pretty insane.&quot; Why would an omnipotent God tolerate rebellion at all? Mercy. Everyone who fails to repent and choose Christ, when called, should instantly die. They don't, though, so rather than a great wasp of a God who stings instantly, we have a patient God who tolerates us. He does not spare us from the consequences of our evil all the time and to our specifications, but it's not like he does nothing; he declares that he wields history like a rod and an axe. He comforts the afflicted, he cares for us, he sends rain for all. My argument is that we have no right to demand he use history to our specification. Does that make sense? He does stop evil, he does prevent suffering, he simply does it to his standard and as he wishes as opposed to how we wish. The MSSOF would, if it acted as we want to, kick all of us out of creation! You and I have both hurt others, and we will hurt more people, and we hurt creation with our corruption.  Rather than a tyrannical and evil God, we have a merciful God who patiently tolerates our failure and has given us a chance to be redeemed. The funny thing about the Christian faith is that we are saved by God - from God. He didn't even damn us; we have damned ourselves by our actions. No one is compelled to sin by God. Or are they?</p>
