<h1>HOW WE GOT THE BIBLE</h1> 
<p>I keep referring to the word &quot;Scripture,&quot; perhaps annoyingly to some who would just wish I would say &quot;the Bible,&quot; but the two are in fact distinct. After all, what if the Bible is missing something important, or has something in it, it rather should not have? 2nd Timothy 3:16-17 says this: &quot;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.&quot;</p>

<p>Romans 3:4 says this (in part): &quot;Let God be true, and every human being a liar.&quot;</p>

<p> That's a fine standard, then, not just from these example verses but the whole of what we know from the prophets and others of authority: if we know all Scripture is God-breathed, that is, infallible words of God spoken through the voices of human authors, the contrapositive can also be assumed: if it is not god breathed, it is not Scripture. And we can only trust God-breathed materials, since every man is a liar. Hold on, though, some may say: &quot;are you using the Bible itself to determine its own trustworthiness?&quot; No, not quite. I use those verses because Scripture offers us its own standard for what qualifies as Scripture and what does not. My point, therefore, is that Scripture tells us what counts, and we are told God spoke through the prophets and Apostles by the Holy Spirit. This means that if a random human being says something concerning God, the proper question to ask them is &quot;who are you? Did God give you authority to speak on this topic? From which of his words do you derive that statement?&quot; The Christian faith is entirely reliant upon the words we have; what words qualify is of the utmost importance. Further, I am, after all, writing about the internal consistency of the Christian God's philosophy, so I can't just arbitrarily toss out works that don't fit in with the others. I must rely on an objective metric for inclusion so as to avoid my own subjective bias.  I will, however, partially agree that the Bible as a human collection is not divine, which is the crux of the issue at hand. That means I need to be able to objectively establish what words are from those Scripture says can validly deliver Scripture. What follows, therefore, is an argument that establishes the core of what we know as the Bible as being valid Scripture; you'll find I have some quibbles about the New Testament at times. What it is not is an exhaustive treatise on authorship and the like; I do delve into that topic somewhat, but it is not my sole focus. Many compelling works concerning the authorship of the gospels and other books have been written.  Second, what I am not discussing much of is the concept of translation. I always hear the tired old argument of &quot;the Bible has been translated and retranslated so many times it's impossible to know what it said.&quot; To this, I can only scoff at someone who apparently can only parrot what they read on the internet. We have the manuscripts, usually from relatively close to their temporal origin, but certainly in their original language. So, I will brook no argument from this particular angle. A somewhat curious variation of this 'attack' is, &quot;the fact there are hundreds of translations refutes the idea that the translation is simple or unambiguous.&quot; But if you think about it for a moment, this one assumes all translations have the same goal, which is simply not the case. Something like the ESV attempts to render a word-for-word translation, whereas the NIV goes for a more thought-for-thought approach.  But all this is broadly moot regardless because we have the manuscripts in the original languages, and they can be checked at will for veracity.  So, without further ado, let's start with the Old Testament. To Christians, the Old Testament is largely indisputable, sans the apocrypha which I'll get to, as Jesus Christ quoted a full twenty four of those books. In fact, the New Testament authors and Jesus quoted all but Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Solomon. Note, that doesn't mean these works aren't inspired, simply that they did not (apparently) say anything the authors needed to back up the particular messages we have on record. They were, however, definitively worthy of inclusion in the Bible, if you note a few other things. Jesus didn't just quote from the Old Testament, he said the following (Luke 24:44): &quot;Now He said to them, 'This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.'&quot;</p>

<p>So Jesus right there, confirmed all of the Law books, all of the Prophets, and Psalms. But we need to take a step back. When I say the &quot;law books,&quot; or &quot;the prophets,&quot; how do I know Jesus was talking about the same ones that we have in our Bible, and not different ones? What about where he says &quot;the Psalms&quot;? This was used as a catch-all to refer to all of the Writings. Jews of Jesus' time lumped the books of the Old Testament into these same three categories, and Christ here is simply naming all three of them. (&quot;The Psalms&quot; included all those works not in the Law of Moses or the Prophets.) Jesus also confirmed much of the canon in Matthew 23:35. How? Well, he gives us the appropriate range of time in which prophets existed: &quot;And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.&quot;</p>

<p>There are many other works that are touted as Scripture, and they are collectively known as the apocrypha. Here is a list of many works that are among the apocrypha (mind, this is the Old Testament apocrypha, there are similar works others believe belong in the New Testament): 1. Tobit 2. Judith 3. 1 Maccabees 4. 2 Maccabees 5. Wisdom of Solomon 6. Ecclesiasticus (Book of Sirach, or Ben Sira/Wisdom of Ben Sira) 7. 1 Esdras 8. 2 Esdras 9. Baruch 10. Letter/Epistle of Jeremiah 11. Additions to Esther 12. Prayer of Azariah 13. Suzanna (often inserted as Daniel 13) 14. Bel and the Dragon 15. Prayer of Manasseh</p>

<p>Problems with these books include: 1. No one in the New Testament quotes or references them. 2. The Jews themselves did not classify any of them as Scripture. 3. Literally one of the books of the Apocrypha itself says that there have been no real prophets in a long time (1 Maccabees 9:27): &quot;There had not been such great distress in Israel since the time prophets ceased to appear among the people.&quot; There were roughly four hundred years of silence between the last prophet and Jesus, and a lot of these books were written in that time.</p>

<p>I can't really think of a better argument than those three. The people group literally charged with the preservation of the word of God didn't think they were inspired, nor did the books themselves. These books may be helpful or even accurate, but they are not inspired.  Summarizing, Jesus mentioned the three categories the Jews were familiar with, and while on the subject did not take the time to identify any of them as being false works of false prophets. Then he gave us the appropriate timeframe in which there were real prophets, and a number of these works appear from outside that timeframe. Lastly, none of these works are quoted by any of the Apostles or Christ that we know of, which while individually is not a fair reason for elimination&#8230; when coupled with the other arguments only adds to the pile.  Next is the New Testament. The New Testament's canon was not decided at any council, let's get that out of the way now. People who don't know what they're talking about, and have never read any ancient author gleefully repeat this falsehood, often in an effort to undermine the character of Jesus by making it easier to worm in strange books about him cursing people to fall off roofs or getting drunk. In order to successfully deal with such works, it is necessary to start with the New Testament authors first, so we have a baseline for what legitimacy looks like. I am going to assume familiarity with names, like Peter and Paul. I don't want to be a spoil sport, but if you don't know who those men are, you should probably not be reading this chapter. You have far more basic questions you need answered, than getting bogged down here. But I digress, here is Jesus on Peter (Matthew 16:18&ndash;19): &quot;And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.&quot;</p>

<p>And here's Peter calling Paul Scripture (emphasis added, 2 Peter 3:15&ndash;16): &quot;Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him. He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.&quot;</p>

<p>Note, this isn't some oddball interpretation; the Greek word here is only used to refer to Old Testament Scripture in the New Testament (more than fifty times). It's used only for Paul, and the Old Testament. Peter puts Paul on the same level as the prophets. If you accept the gospel of Luke, Acts is its second part written by the same man, and it very clearly depicts Paul as an Apostle, accepted by the other Apostles. Ignatius and Polycarp, disciples of John the Apostle, likewise spoke of Paul as an Apostle, and the only way that is possible is if John the Apostle thought Paul was a real Apostle. So anyone who asserts that Paul was not a real apostle are claiming they know more about Paul than John, Peter, and Luke. People don't typically attack Peter's authority on the whole, though, largely because of the above-quoted verse. They do, however, attack 2nd Peter quite frequently, saying it is a fabrication. Clement of Rome is a first century source, and Clement was called by Paul in Philippians 4:3 his &quot;fellow worker,&quot; and in fact succeeded Peter as Bishop of Rome. 1 Clement chapter 23 (First Clement: Clement of Rome) quotes 2 Peter 3:4 as Scripture. We thus find that disputing 2nd Peter means disagreeing with someone who knew him and knew he wrote it! The next most common attack is around 2nd Peter's date: you find people saying that it was written far too late to be from Peter. Fortunately, we know Clement's document is pre 70 AD because he mentions the temple as still standing, which cements 2nd Peter's date as likewise pre-70 AD: &quot;Not in every place, brethren, are the daily sacrifices offered, or the peace-offerings, or the sin-offerings and the trespass-offerings, but in Jerusalem only. And even there they are not offered in any place, but only at the altar before the temple, that which is offered being first carefully examined by the high priest and the ministers already mentioned.&quot; With Peter settled, and Paul established as an Apostle, here is Paul making it clear Luke was writing Scripture (1 Timothy 5:18): &quot;For Scripture says, 'Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,' and 'The worker deserves his wages.'&quot;</p>

<p>Paul quotes Moses and Luke in the same sentence, and calls them both Scripture. I've heard people say &quot;No, Paul is just calling the Deuteronomy verse Scripture and he happens to quote Luke afterwards.&quot; Here, let me add some emphasis to the verse to clear this up: &quot;For Scripture says, [Moses] and [Luke].&quot;  No identifying mark separating the two. Paul wasn't stupid. He was very careful with his word choice at all times. He quoted the exact Greek used by Luke, and did not separate it from the quote from Deuteronomy, but added to it (check the Greek if you feel so inclined). There is no reasonable, or even plausible, argument one can make for why he would not have done something incredibly simple and overt to separate the enlightened word of God from some dude's words.  So, Peter, Paul, and Luke are all referenced as Scripture. That leaves us with James, Jude, Matthew, John, and Mark. Matthew and John were Apostles, which is its own justification (in terms of internal consistency). As Apostles, they had quite a level of authority; Luke 11:49, for instance, places Apostles and prophets on the same level. As for the work that bears Matthew's name, Papias (Fragments of Papias) referenced him directly, as did Irenaeus, making the authorship solid. Mark is presumably the Mark referenced as a companion of Paul, and is as such someone Paul considered a faithful servant (Clement also references him as an author of a gospel). Does that elevate his writing to the 'inspired' level? Unclear. But it bears going more in-depth on the authorship and dates of the gospels. Let's hear a detractor's viewpoint on this: &quot;The canonical gospels are all anonymous. The names we currently know them by were not attached to them until the late second century AD. The gospels themselves never name their authors and the earliest known references to them refer to them as anonymous works. Although there are apocryphal gospels that do actually claim to have been written by apostles, it is widely agreed among modern scholars that these gospels are all forgeries.&quot; Oh my, if true, this would be very bad! A powerful attack indeed. Except, it's complete nonsense. Did you catch the fallacy of the majority? &quot;Oh a lot of people think this so it's more likely to be true!&quot; Nonsense, for reasons three seconds of critical thought can provide. If that were true, for a while there it would have been &quot;more likely to be true&quot; that the Sun went around the Earth because most people thought it so.  Frankly, the majority of the arguments against the authorship-as-held for the New Testament are laughably stupid. I wish these weren't the same arguments people who have PhDs in this stuff use, but they are. Go read the Wikipedia entries on 'date' for the gospels, it's pretty ridiculous stuff. &quot;Oh well, this Gospel tackles ideas popular in the 3rd century so it was written then.&quot; Jules Verne wrote about spaceships, so I suppose he was writing in the 1960s when they were popular? Nonsense! &quot;Luke's theology is dissimilar to Paul's so he can't have been his companion!&quot; So you aren't allowed to disagree with someone and be their friend? Nonsense!  Anyways, let's start with Luke. Acts, also written by Luke, ends with Paul in prison, and does not record his execution; that would have been included if it had occurred already, which places the date of writing of Acts and Luke at least pre-70 AD. Luke noted, in Acts 11:28 a prophecy that was fulfilled: &quot;And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world (this took place in the days of Claudius).&quot;</p>

<p>He did not note that Christ's prediction of the destruction of Jerusalem was fulfilled in 70 AD. That limits the date of authorship to pre-70 AD. Many times in Acts, the author says &quot;we&quot; in reference to Paul. No reason has ever been advanced for this other than, &quot;well the book was written in the 2nd century so obviously these are false insertions to enhance the credibility of the author.&quot; I doubt I need to tell you there's circular reasoning going on there. Paul mentions a number of gentile companions of his, but the most prominent of them are referred to in the 3rd person in Acts: Mark (12:12, 12:25, 15, 16, 17), Timothy (16:1, 16:3, several in 17, 18, 19, 20), Aristarchus (19:29, 20:4, 27:2), and Tychicus (20:4). Thus, these men are not the author. Luke is mentioned by Paul several times, notably in Colossians and Timothy. Again, though, there's no ancient source that says anyone but Luke wrote it.</p>

<p>While Paul mentions several men, Aristarchus, Tychicus, Timothy, and Mark are mentioned in the third person within the text and so are ruled out as candidates for authorship of Acts. Of the remaining possibilities, the consensus of early Christian tradition points to Luke as the author of Luke-Acts. This is what was passed on by Irenaeus and Tertullian, and the earliest manuscript of this gospel has the inscription &quot;According to Luke.&quot; There are no early Christian traditions that attribute this gospel to anyone other than Luke, and the earliest manuscripts call it Luke's, and the earliest church references from Irenaeus and Tertullian call it Luke's.  So&#8230; everybody from then that we have record of said &quot;Yep, it's Luke's,&quot; and the arguments against it rely on dating it later than the text itself circumstantially dates itself. One such attempt says that &quot;well, linguistically, the reference to eyewitnesses and 'from the beginning' in Luke 1:2 implies the distant past,&quot; but there is no definiteness in the Greek.  I'm really trying to not sound overly dismissive of the arguments against authorship, but it's fairly hard to do when they're all so incredibly bad. Critical scholars never, in the attempts to confuse authorship I have seen, have a good answer for why everyone in the early church said &quot;Yep it's Luke's,&quot; which is really where this should start, yeah? For instance, if I hand you a book and say &quot;This guy named Lucas from my home town wrote this,&quot; and you go to my home town and everyone there says &quot;Yeah Lucas wrote that, albeit a while ago,&quot; and then, someone comes along and says &quot;This book wasn't written by anyone named Lucas, because [whatever].&quot; This person has absolutely no answer to why I or the people in my home town say Lucas wrote the book. Does that not instantly put their argument on terrible footing? I leave the question to you. Let's do John next, though. Funnily enough, in order to disagree with the authorship of John, you have to, from the outset, assume that its author is lying. See from John 21:22-24: &quot;When Peter saw him, he asked, 'Lord, what about him?' Jesus answered, 'If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.' Because of this, the rumor spread among the believers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, 'If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?' This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>So the gospel itself points its authorship at John. Detractors must begin with &quot;well the gospel is wrong,&quot; to have anything resembling a claim here. You can see the circular reasoning coming like a semi-truck at 2 am. The Rylands papyrus contains fragments from John 18, and it's from the 120s AD. The gospel was nearly certainly written sometime during John's life, thus, and his surviving companions, if not the man himself, would not have allowed such a document bearing his name to be circulated without disputing it. As far as the exact year, I couldn't say (I touched on the matter elsewhere in the book regardless). Polycarp, who I mentioned was a disciple of John the Apostle, taught Irenaeus, who said this: &quot;John, the disciple of the Lord, who also had leaned upon His breast, did himself publish a Gospel during his residence at Ephesus in Asia.&quot; The Anti-Marcionite Prologue, prologues written for each of the gospels, record that Papias, who knew John, was John's scribe. This is a little suspect, as the date for these prologues is 150-400 AD, so either &quot;kinda close&quot; or &quot;uselessly postdated.&quot; The only thing in its favor as being genuine is part of the epilogue of John, John 21:24, note the 'we': &quot;This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.&quot;</p>

<p>That would lend credence to the fact that John used a scribe, or scribes, as the Anti-Marcionite Prologue states. This is a small yet very important detail for someone to have gotten right hundreds of years later! Frankly, the book itself says John the Apostle wrote it, so you either accept that or you don't, and then you reject the accuracy of Scripture itself and issues of authorship become trifles in comparison. Manuscripts such as  I had a good argument about John with someone, who gave the following argument against his authorship in response to the above (summarized): &quot;But John's gospel does not identify this beloved disciple or the one who Jesus loved as John the Apostle. The internal evidence is a little too good, don't you think, that he wrote it? Last, why does the beloved disciple only appear in John 13 and later, the last week of Jesus Christ's life? Also, isn't his Christology a little high for a fisherman?&quot; Ah, but it does identify him as such, in John 13:23, it says the author was reclining at Christ's side, thus, an Apostle. More certainly, John, since he, Peter, and James saw the transfiguration in Matthew 17, so it makes sense John would be right at Christ's side. Too good? Many verses indicate an intimate understanding of what occurred in Christ's inner circle. I have never received a good answer for what &quot;good enough&quot; would be that John wrote it instead of too good or not good enough. Subjective. The third objection, that of John's &quot;high Christology,&quot; is an old and oft-repeated one. It too is dismissed as subjective; but I'll flip that around. If whoever wrote John, 1 John, 2 John, and 3 John wasn't an Apostle, who on earth were they? No one writes such deep theology except for the Apostles, so it would be fairly ridiculous to assume whoever did write them wasn't an extremely well known and influential author among the early church. Yet, we have no other texts that bear any similarity in style to these works. It occurs to me I haven't touched on how we know John wrote the 3 letters attributed to him. There's ancient attestation to his authorship of the letters, and most everybody agrees all four works are written by the same person. So if John wrote the gospel&#8230; but of course, some disagree that they were written by the same person, because critical scholars need to eat and nobody pays them if they don't come up with something, right? So there are random quibbles over stylistic preferences which just&#8230; sure, fine, there are minor stylistic differences between a remembered description of the life and times of (who the author believed to be) the incarnate Christ and letters he wrote about theology. Ok? That's the best they've got? What a waste of time. You'd think if these guys were in the right and were getting paid to undermine Christianity and had centuries to think of and find ways to doubt the authorship of these works they could do better than, &quot;uhh his writing is kinda different.&quot; Matthew's authorship is up next. Matthew the Apostle himself was a tax collector, and it's curious that his gospel focuses on financial matters at the temple moreso than the others, no? Circumstantial I grant, but let's move on. I already touched on Matthew, but I didn't specify who this &quot;Papias&quot; was that I used to defend authorship of his gospel. Again, Papias said this: &quot;Matthew put together the oracles [of the Lord] in the Hebrew style, and each one interpreted them as best he could.&quot; He lived from AD 60-130, bang on for the timeframe, and no ancient source doubts Matthew's authorship. Irenaeus, again, mentions Matthew as the author and gives information independent of what Papias said, meaning he had a different source for his information than Papias. Like Luke, nobody from the time period suggested Matthew didn't write it, and the manuscript's title, added no later than 125 AD, says Matthew wrote it. Also, since Matthew was a tax collector&#8230; he's unlikely to have been popular with the Jews, and he's not really mentioned that much in the New Testament, so if someone is going to forge a gospel intended for Jewish readership, they'd be unlikely to pick Matthew.  The claims against it are, yet again, really weak in light of the information in support of it. I don't even think they're worth answering, but that won't be super convincing to anyone who doesn't live in my skull. And again, these are the arguments I've sought out and that have been used against me in debates. If I've missed one you consider &quot;bulletproof for sure,&quot; I'm reachable. Get it to me and I'll add it below. 1. If Matthew was an eye-witness to Christ's life and works, why did he use Mark as a source? 2. Matthew couldn't have written such high-quality Greek. 3. Mark and Luke call the tax collector &quot;Levi&quot;, so why did Matthew change nothing about that event except to change the name &quot;Levi&quot; to Matthew (Luke 5:27, Mark 2:14, Matthew 9:9)? Both Matthew and Levi were Semitic names, so while it was common for persons in that era to have a Semitic and Greek name, two Semitic names was unusual. 4. There are a couple notable contradictions between horizontal passages in Matthew and the other gospels that Matthew wouldn't have made if he were the author: a. Mark 5:22-24, Matthew 9:18-19. In Mark, Jauris' daughter isn't dead, in Matthew she is. b. Luke 3:23-38; Matthew 1:1-17. There are genealogical differences.</p>

<p>1. Have you ever told a story in collaboration with others? People highlight different parts of things, remember different things, and have their memory filled in by others. This is how humans tell stories of things they saw. What a circumstantial argument! 2. Says who? Galilea was a bilingual area, and Matthew had to talk to a lot of different people given his position. There's reason enough to see he was bilingual. There is some reasonable contention about whether Matthew wrote the Greek gospel in his name, or someone close to him used his Hebrew work to make it. I have no opinion either way; it doesn't particularly matter, since the material is Matthew's. 3. It is entirely possible that Christ gave Matthew his name, much as he did with Peter, or like what happened with Abram or Jacob who became Abraham and Israel, so there is cultural precedent, and Matthew means &quot;gift of God&quot;. Further, the other two gospels do call him the Apostle Matthew in Luke 6 and Mark 3. Luke and Mark wrote the name Christ literally used; Matthew wrote who was called.  4. Let's see here. Note, I'm not particularly after resolving these &quot;contradictions&quot;, which will happen as an aside, but moreso the differences between the gospels in these sections.  a. Mark gives us way more detail about the event than Matthew does. It's fairly irresponsible to hold a summary and a detailed description up as a &quot;contradiction,&quot; but no matter. Mark says Jairus told Christ the daughter was at &quot;the point of death&quot;, Matthew says &quot;has just died&quot;. When you look at this, you go &quot;hmmm, bad,&quot; but this is why we don't listen to people who only use the modern English version of the texts. Greek doesn't work the same way as English, and the word arti means &quot;this instant, exactly now&quot; or &quot;something in process being finished even now&quot;. This is a difficult word to translate, and it is that translation issue that makes this look like a contradiction. But the structural point here is that Matthew is summarizing something, so he says the same thing as Mark in fewer words, and uses arti to convey the summarized concept. I don't find the fact that Matthew summarized a story Mark told in detail to be indicative of much of anything except focus preferences amongst the authors. b. When presented with this as evidence against Matthew's authorship, I didn't quite grasp how it mattered. It was explained that Matthew, a Jew, and specifically a record keeping tax collector, would not have missed people in the genealogy of Christ when the gentile doctor got it right. Curious indeed! But in fact, this is an extremely clever thing Matthew has done. Do you know who Matthew left out? He left out the false sons of David; Special Article F, in point of fact, is about one of the men Matthew left out, and how God spurned him. So, we find not that Matthew was a bad Jew, but that Matthew understood the nature of being a son of David more than most Christians today, and better than many Jews of the time. No wonder Christ called him from his booth. Now for Mark, that I've also mentioned briefly. The funny thing is, critical scholars like to claim that Luke used Mark as a source, so if Luke was written in the 60s AD&#8230; Mark was written incredibly early. Eusebius, another early church father, did not like Papias, rather some of his theology, so we know when he quotes him it's more likely to be genuine. Here is Eusebius quoting Papias about Mark: &quot;&#8230;also said this, 'Mark, being the interpreter of Peter, whatsoever he remembered he wrote accurately, but not however in the order that these things were spoken or done by our Lord. For he neither heard the Lord, nor followed him, but afterwards, as I said, he was with Peter, who did not make a complete account of the Lord's logia, but constructed his teachings according to chreiai. So Mark did nothing wrong in writing down single matters as he remembered them, for he gave special attention to one thing, of not passing by anything he heard, and not falsifying anything in these matters&#8230;'&quot; Mark thus has probably the best external witness of the gospels. I haven't found any interesting arguments against Mark's authorship and when told about Papias, people generally move on to other topics concerning Mark as opposed to his authorship.  Also, one final point bears mentioning: compare the difference between Hebrews, an actual anonymous book, with these ones. We are still, to this day, openly debating the authorship of Hebrews! It's not like Christianity has papered over anonymous works in the canon; the one that is there is openly admitted, and the situation looks starkly different from what critical scholars claim about the gospels. Off from the gospels we go. There's a bit more to say about James. In Galatians 2:9 he is called a &quot;pillar&quot; along with Peter and John, which may or may not imply Paul places his words on the same level as theirs; I'm unsure, but we at least know Paul considered him someone worth listening to if he's a 'pillar.' Galatians 1:19 likewise might be referring to James as an apostle. However, the wording is unclear; Paul says 'none of the other apostles, only James,' which may mean that he didn't see the apostles besides himself, but he saw James there, or he didn't see any apostles besides James. (The original text is, of course, similarly unclear.) Jesus appeared to James (1 Corinthians 15:7). Taken together, all three pieces of evidence put James as being worthy of inclusion. As for authorship, the usual. For what it's worth, we have some bona fide words of James from Acts 15:13-29, and textual analysis reveals it strongly resembles how the book of James is written.  I see no clear evidence that Jude is of the same authority level as our top group. The book of 2nd Peter closely resembles Jude, so it's not exactly problematic that it is included. It seems to imply in verse 1:1 that the author is the brother of James, making him another half-brother of Jesus. The author does not seem to label themselves an Apostle (Jude 1:17): &quot;But you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,&quot;</p>

<p>But it is likely James edited the book, or helped with it. So it was most likely written under apostolic guidance, which somewhat explains its inclusion. The only other bit of evidence in its favor is this verse here, 1 Corinthians 9:5: &quot;Don't we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as do the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas&quot;</p>

<p>This verse seems to place the (half) brothers of the Lord on the same footing as the Apostles and Peter, so that could very well elevate him. This book has the weakest footing of the canon, in my opinion. However, it does not fail the standards that exclude the vast majority of the apocrypha, and Jude being Christ's half-brother does lend him a certain standing&#8230; If I sound unsure about what conclusion to make, it's because I am: Jude offers sound advice, but is Jude Scripture? If pressed, I may say that Jude should be taken out, which may upset a rather large number of Christians who consider the Bible sacrosanct and not Scripture, but I don't see bold confirmation of or definite witness to it being Scripture from where I stand. I would thus argue you need to treat Jude with more suspicion than you do any other book of the Bible, or just rely on 2nd Peter since it contains most everything Jude says anyways. Paul's got a lot of letters attributed to him. Romans, 1 &amp; 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians, 1 &amp; 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon. Shockingly, critical scholars actually just gave up and admitted the guy actually wrote Galatians, Romans, Philippians, Philemon, 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians, and 1 &amp; 2 Corinthians. That leaves, by my reckoning, Timothy, Colossians, and Ephesians. Colossians they doubt because it has words not used by Paul, but it&#8230; says Timothy helped&#8230; so there's a rather easy explanation there don't you think?  This is just not worth it, dear reader. The manuscripts all say Paul wrote these letters either by himself, or with a scribe, but he oversaw every word, and everyone in antiquity went &quot;yep, Paul wrote them,&quot; so I frankly do not care what modern scholars say here, unless they have something good, which of course they don't. There's just no argument other than &quot;uhh it's kinda written differently,&quot; which is subjective nonsense. Literally. Here is a quote from a scholar disputing these: &quot;&#8230;these letters are from when the church's theological convictions and organizational needs had matured beyond what is presumed of the period in which Paul lived&#8230;&quot; Presumed! Prove it! They don't, though, ever. They just say &quot;well we think it would've been like this.&quot; This is an aside, but I really wish people would learn that just because you can come up with an objection, does not mean you have come up with a forceful objection, or supporting objection, or countermanding objection automatically, as in, one that outweighs the evidence for the opposite position. Since all the manuscripts support the traditional authorship, all the ancient sources support it, all the dating supports it&#8230; they resort to this kind of nonsense. So, Paul wrote these. All of them. He was an Apostle, and they are thus Scripture. Onward!  What's left? Revelation? Hebrews? I've touched on Revelation previously in the book in terms of date, and the book says John wrote it, so if you doubt that, you doubt Scripture's accuracy and we have a bigger issue outside the intent of this chapter. Hebrews is thus last. People love to say that Hebrews is uninspired or apocryphal: yet all of the early churches placed this letter with the other Pauline epistles, and I see no reason to disagree with them. Eusebius, for instance, talks of Clement quoting it, showing that it wasn't a recent creation (recent to him, that is; he was writing several hundred years after the fact). Eusebius had this to say of it: &quot;Wherefore it has seemed reasonable to reckon it with the other writings of the apostle. For as Paul had written to the Hebrews in his native tongue, some say that the evangelist Luke, others that this Clement himself, translated the epistle.&quot; &#8230; &quot;He says that the Epistle [an epistle is a letter, more or less] to the Hebrews is the work of Paul, and that it was written to the Hebrews in the Hebrew language; but that Luke translated it carefully and published it for the Greeks, and hence the same style of expression is found in this epistle and in the Acts. But he says that the words, Paul the apostle, were probably not prefixed, because, in sending it to the Hebrews, who were prejudiced and suspicious of him, he wisely did not wish to repel them at the very beginning by giving his name.&quot; A biblical piece of evidence for this is that Peter, when writing to the Jews himself, mentioned that Paul had done the same in 2 Peter 3:15&ndash;16. So we have a Scriptural confirmation Paul did write to the Jews; but is it Hebrews? I see no reason to assume otherwise. Vague claims of &quot;it doesn't read like something written x way&quot; are not really particularly strong refutations, either, as I have been saying over and over and over in this section. Hebrews 2:3: &quot;how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard,&quot;</p>

<p>Seems to cast doubts on Pauline authorship, though, as Paul vehemently argued elsewhere in Galatians that he had no need of hearing from the Apostles since Christ appeared to him directly. So, in my view, the best answer is that Luke assisted Paul in writing it. Luke was never ashamed of using sources, as he said in his own gospel. See Hebrews 13:23: &quot;You should know that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom I shall see you if he comes soon.&quot;</p>

<p>We know, of course, Timothy knew both Luke and Paul and was Paul's companion, so this strengthens the case. The text shows an impressive understanding of the Old Testament, which strangely I see some using to doubt that Paul wrote it? Do they not know who Paul was before he became a Christian? He was a Pharisee, a great student of the law. He knew his stuff. Now we get into the canon itself, the assemblage of the Bible. I'm not going to go into a whole lot about the people involved, and I'm going to run through it fairly quickly, because I'm not after what human tradition defends as worthy of inclusion. The whole point here is that of &quot;who does Scripture say had the authority to write Scripture?&quot; But it is nonetheless important to know how these works got to us, their provenance. Take it as a whirlwind big picture framework to get some things straight in your head to fill in if you do other research, or to compare against if you hear various claims being made. The conclusion, though, is this: as early as the second or third century we already had the canon assembled. Anyone who says anything different will not be able to refute the following.  2. The Murtorian Fragment (late 2nd century) attributed Acts to Luke, and Paul's letters were listed, among others. It alluded to Jude, left out 1st and 2nd Peter and 3rd John, and said the apocryphal Wisdom of Solomon was written by 'friends of Solomon in his honor.' 3. Justin Martyr (110&ndash;165), in First Apology wrote that the writings of the apostles were read alongside the prophets in the Sunday assemble (&quot;First Apology,&quot; 1:186).  4. Origen (185&ndash;254), a much lauded church father, wrote about Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John (&quot;Church History of Eusebius,&quot; Chapter XXV:273) he also mentioned Paul and his writings, 1 Peter, 1 John, and Revelation. He listed 2 Peter and 2 and 3 John as disputed by some, but referenced the raising of Eutychus (Acts 20) as genuine. In Homilies on Joshua, he confirmed the twenty seven books of the New Testament (this can be found in homily 7). This was in 250 AD. Do note, if you go read the section, that Origen clearly included Hebrews as Pauline.  5. Eusebius (270&ndash;339), a historian of the church, wrote that Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John were undisputed. He added Acts and the works of Paul, 1 John, and 1 Peter. He labeled Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude and Revelation as disputed.  6. Athanasius (296&ndash;373) listed the canon as we know it as settled (Letter 39, section 5). Books that were old, yet not as reliable, were removed, such as the Didache (as noted by Athanasius).  Now we get to the New Testament apocrypha. These were often written too late, or too far away, to be seriously considered as inspired; they were sometimes written by the heretical branches of Christianity, such as the Gnostics. For instance, to demonstrate the scale of the problem, a man named Photius (9th century) listed about 280 apocryphal works. There are so many it is impossible to go through them all in a non-exhaustive treatise such as this. I'll present a general framework and cover some examples, though: I have never seen an apocryphal work that can attest to the following, like all of the books in the New Testament: 1. Written at the appropriate time. As in, during the lifetimes of the people spoken about in verified Scripture. Remember that there were no more prophets after Jesus, so Apostolic authority was the only kind you could have, and when they died&#8230; it was all done.  2. Written in the appropriate geographic region(s). 3. Verified as written by an Apostle or prophet, or under their close guidance. Any single apocryphal book you present to me, I will show you how it violates at least two of these, generally all three. Often, they violate a fourth: they contradict other Scripture. This is perhaps the most damning critique for those of us inside the church.  There were some, such as the Shepherd of Hermas, and 1 and 2 Corinthians from Clement, that were listed with the actual New Testament on occasion, but they were placed after Revelation, in the fashion of an appendix. Often, the authors themselves didn't try to claim the work as inspired (such as Polycarp to the Philippians). The fact is, they were written too late, and by non-Apostles and non-prophets. The early fathers rejected many works out of hand, such as the Gospel of Thomas or the Infancy Gospel of Thomas, the latter of which wasn't even written until the second century. The latter is also refuted by John chapter 2:11: &quot;What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs through which he revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.&quot;</p>

<p>If turning water into wine was Jesus' first sign, then one can hardly claim that he used his powers to curse children and others in his childhood. It's a Gnostic forgery, simple as that. There is one book that requires more effort than the others, and is generally a more interesting path to being definitely labeled as apocryphal, and that is the Book of Enoch. However, this section is a brief overview, and spending pages in the main matter of the work on one liar's book is not my intent. Thus, if you are interested in the refutation itself, it is noted in the Special Articles section.  I see the Early Church Fathers being used as weapons for nefarious agendas more and more these days. I am compelled to state: the Church Fathers were not perfect. Honestly, this is perhaps the greatest evidence to defend the claim that Scripture does not derive its authority from mere men; often, you will hear it said that Tertullian supported the book of Enoch, for instance. However, he said this in a work he wrote after he had fallen to Montanism, a heretical branch of Christianity. The words of a heretic mean scarcely little as to what is legitimate. You should be incredibly careful when people make claims about what church fathers did or did not say. If a person does not give you the exact reference to a work so that you may find it yourself, I would assume they are lying about it. For example, I was once called by an FBI agent with regards to a case. The agent called me and told me to call him back at the publicly available number for that field office, to verify that he was a real FBI agent, and more or less hung up. He provided a legitimate source for his claims, and you should ask the same of quotations from the church fathers. I see this most often with Origen's De Principiis and this behavior is also rampant with his Contra Celsus, because in treating the extremely nonsensical and heretical arguments of a heretic named Celsus, he must repeat them; which means there are quotes of Origen &quot;saying&quot; certain heretical things, but then in the next breath refuting them.  And that's pretty much it. If you trust Scripture, I hope you now have a stronger confidence in the works you hold dear. Except for Jude, anyways. Sorry, Jude. EPILOGUE You know, thinking back to my first chapter where I swore up and down that &quot;oh this is the only chapter full of dense noggin nuggets,&quot; I think I lied. When I consider all the chapters of this book, none of them are particularly easy reading or lacking in winding arguments. If you're reading the epilogue, though, you must have read some great measure of the work's main body. So what's left? Why, when you look at the pages left, or if you have a digital copy the progress bar wherever the UI designer decided to throw it, does there seem to be so much left? Because there are still many issues left to cover, but that did not fit inside my main narrative. Christianity is a sweeping entity, and God is an all encompassing concept. The Special Articles cover some of those topics that are decidedly important, but not spinal in terms of importance to the faith.  As the theologian Spurgeon once said, though &ndash; &quot;It is God's word that saves souls, not our comment upon it, however correct that comment may be.&quot; I make no pretenses that Scripture has need of my commentary, or that I can add anything to it. Much like a rocket flying to the Moon, my explanation of the mechanics of that flight add nothing to the majesty of the flight itself. Where I have erred, this is my fault alone.  And so, I will leave you with two verses, one warning, and one message of hope. You see, the world is increasingly becoming anti-Christian, especially in the West, whereas in other parts of the world we were already largely scorned and attacked. But our enemies are intermingled with those who can be saved; separating the two is difficult work. Every day, our enemies twist Scripture, trying to make it say what they want it to say. Every day, they stew on how to make it less urgent, less dependable, less applicable. Those who oppose Christianity have had 2,000 years to come up with arguments against it, and make no mistake: they are increasingly sophisticated attacks. Christianity itself makes great intellectual demands of its followers, and I firmly believe we must all rise to the occasion and understand our faith and be able to defend it. Every day, something God declared evil, man declares righteous. You will be disliked for disagreeing with these things. It will seem like these are such petty things to lose friends or jobs over believing, and you may give up on them piecemeal. It may not seem worth it; you have a job, a life, what's getting into these discussions worth? But that is how we are swallowed: no one is swallowed whole; but piece by piece.  Colossians 2:8: &quot;See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.&quot;</p>

<p>And an excerpt from 2 Corinthians 5: &quot;All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God. God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.&quot;</p>

<p>Supposing that I should have the courage To let a red sword of virtue Plunge into my heart, Letting to the weeds of the ground My sinful blood, What can you offer me? A gardened castle? A flowery kingdom? What? A hope? Then hence with your red sword of virtue. Stephen Crane, The Black Riders and other Lines, XXX</p>

<p>Deep down, we don't believe that God is happy.  And while normally I avoid making sweeping generalizations about my audience, I stand by the firm use of &quot;we&quot; there. Those readers who are Christians don't act like God is happy, and those who are not almost certainly don't. I don't mean that if asked, &quot;Is God happy?&quot; we couldn't produce some answer to the effect of &quot;God is full of divine joy.&quot; Many chapters ago, I described the community of God, the three persons. Maybe you picture three swirling balls of light with fancy neon effects tracing around them. Or maybe you picture three kings seated on thrones. Who knows! But what I can very nearly guarantee is that you do not picture anybody doing anything resembling smiling or expressing happiness. So when I say, 'we don't believe that God is happy,' I mean, we don't remember God is happy, we act like the pagans of yore: &quot;no other people had so much as contemplated that such a thing might be possible&quot; when confronted with the idea that God might make a covenant with human beings. Which is the point of this brief interlude: I want to bring to your attention some of the uniqueness of what first Judaism and now Christianity have brought to the world.  I also don&rsquo;t mean that God is exclusively happy or only happy. Of course not. He has many emotions (despite not being emotional). Further, I want to address something else: the modern world has adopted much of the gifts of Christianity, but has forgotten or scorned the giver of those gifts. When Paul wrote Galatians, or when he wrote Philemon, the world and its assumptions were vastly different. Today, though the fight in practical terms is not over, most cultures take for granted that all people have inherent worth. Where do you think that came from? The natural progression of man's philosophy as he became richer and fatter? No. The richest, the fattest, the Romans and the Greeks, the Persians, the Han, Mansa Musa&rsquo;s Mali, they thought that a person's worth was the weight of gold and land and slaves they possessed. If you study the Greek philosophers especially, you find this idea, in say The Republic or Gorgias that inflicting suffering on another is not wrong because it is an injustice to another, but for what it does to your soul. I won't go into a long digression on the Stoics or whoever else's ideas of virtue, good, bad, indifference, et cetera as they relate to worth; there simply was no conception of human beings as having intrinsic value or worth (perhaps something like axia in the Greek, but it does not mean value the way I intend it).  In Asia Minor, Buddhists have occasionally allowed for some intrinsic dignity, but in a sense of acquired dignity, our ability to discern and choose right and wrong given our privileged status of comprehending morality: your 'capacity for enlightenment' as it has been put by some modern interpreters. However, if we look at the early Buddhist schools, we find that one's worth is in fact tied to the amount of enlightenment they have attained, not their 'capacity' for it: &quot;it would be even more fruitful if one would feed a single arahant [one with insight]. As great as the brahmin Vela&#772;ma's alms offering was, and though one would feed a hundred arahants, it would be even more fruitful if one would feed a single paccekabuddha [a solitary buddha who has achieved enlightenment]. As great as the brahmin Vela&#772;ma's alms offering was, and though one would feed a hundred paccekabuddhas, it would be even more fruitful if one would feed a single Perfectly Enlightened Buddha&#8230;&quot;  Confucius, I have read much, but saw little that was more than the standard virtue-ethic type idealism typical of non-Christian cultures; there are many references to virtue and character, and the 'superior man' is superior in his virtue. Of course, there are many possible meanings of 'superior,' it seems to me most likely this references 'righteous superiority' as opposed to some statement about individual worth. This quote though: &quot;A youth is to be regarded with respect. How do we know that his future will not be equal to our present? If he reach the age of forty or fifty, and has not made himself heard of, then indeed he will not be worth being regarded with respect.&quot; Implies to me much similarity with the Greek philosophers, and matches up with the other cultural views previously examined. I have attempted to research the issue in South American religions, such as the polytheism of the Olmecs, Aztecs, and Incas, with little success, as well as those of Africa or classical Shintoism in Japan (which is less of a religion to begin with, and of course has no authoritative classical text to turn to). Generally though, where I have found information on the matter in polytheistic or animist traditions, the answer is a resounding &quot;no.&quot; I cannot, of course, say it never arose elsewhere, but if we examine the states of such cultures at the time they were encountered by Christianity or Judaism, it had never become an accepted and dominating cultural idea anywhere else.  I don't intend to treat all the various cultural advances brought about by Christianity; I leave it to you to consider cultural ideals before Christianity and their ideals today, and draw your own conclusions; that did not happen by accident. Taking care of the poor, the idea that a slave was just as worthy as a rich man&#8230; as Tom Holland, an atheist by the way, wrote in Dominion, &quot;[Paul's] was a conception of law that would come to suffuse an entire civilization.&quot;  He further said, &quot;Paul, by proclaiming the body 'a temple of the Holy Spirit', &#8230; was also giving to those who serviced [men of Rome and Corinth], the bar girls and the painted boys in brothels, the slaves used without compunction by their masters, a glimpse of salvation. &#8230; If all were equally redeemed by Christ, if all were equally beloved of God, then what of the hierarchies on which the functioning of even the humblest Roman household depended?&quot; Yet more, he said, &quot;The gods cared nothing for the poor. &#8230; The heroes of the Iliad, favorites of the gods, golden and predatory, had scorned the weak and downtrodden. So too &#8230; had philosophers. Only fellow citizens of good character who, through no fault of their own, had fallen on evil days might conceivably merit assistance.&quot;   I don't particularly expect this to be a convincing argument, as it is essentially saying &quot;You owe the very ethics you attack Christianity with, to Christianity,&quot; which I don't often find much disagreement with to begin with. The reply is usually, &quot;And now we do them better, and want Christianity to get rid of those things that have fallen behind our continued moral development. Polytheism gave way to monotheism which gives way to atheism.&quot; (Or as I would quip, selfism and dollarism, but those twin threads have always been in the braid of mankind's ethical hairdo.)  I would argue, though, that the modern world's ethics are, in essence, designed to make you feel at home here. Argue with a man who butchers animals painfully, and he&rsquo;ll say that&rsquo;s how it happens in nature. &#8230;And in many cases, so are those of 'churches.' Granted, there are a lot of sources of antagonism against the church that are not fair. When the church does anything wrong, it is headline news. But nobody sees the homeless shelter run by the sixty year old elder of the church, working to get those who show up jobs and food and some human company. Nobody sees the free groceries stall every Tuesday.   But many false 'churches' do exist, and they do things like sell signed Bibles. Signed. By who? Some, by American politicians, some by the pastor. There are other 'churches' that have sold out to fill seats, offering a small music concert, then some fellow tells you it's ok you're constantly breaking God's commands and making no effort to change who you are, as long as you've accepted Christ into your heart all is forgiven. These fools have sold themselves, and I do believe most of them genuinely think that's how Christianity works, on the lie that God expects nothing of you but emotional repentance every now and again. That you can forget God daily or for weeks at a time. True! You can always run back to God. But being a Christian is being part of God's family; is what I have described the actions of someone who is genuine about wanting to be part of a family?  The fool's response here is that Christ was all about inclusivity; and sure, to a point: he ate with sinners. But here's what this crowd glosses over or doesn't recognize: everybody at that table knew they were a sinner, and knew Christ knew it, and knew they needed help. Today's crowd wields this very differently. They want to sit at that table exactly as they are and feel no need to change. As I have said before, and as Scripture warns severely, Christians must approach the sin of others with incredible humility. But we must still approach it. Love is defined for us in 1 Corinthians 13: &ldquo;Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So with that in mind, and also bearing all the Scripture that says we are to love our neighbor, and all the other Scripture that discusses dealing with sin humbly, we are called to hate sin and told God approves when we hate it. (Psalm 119:163, 119:104, 97:10, 45:7&#8230; etc.) Hating sin is fully approved of. What we are not to do is condemn others, but to tell them where we, fellow blind beggars, found light and bread. And warn them of what happens to rebels who persist in their way. Loving your neighbor does not mean pretending their actions are not sinful, it does not mean not telling them they are sinning. It is very clear on how you are supposed to go about those things, yes: humbly and with love. It&rsquo;s a fine line! Do we think we&rsquo;re better? Absolutely not. I would carve my tongue out before I said I was better than anyone else. I have on Christ&rsquo;s robes, and that&rsquo;s the only thing that keeps me from the cold. Nor is my job to force my view on anyone.  When the supposed Christian dies, and they stand before the great white throne, I imagine Jesus may ask this question: &quot;When faced with moral dilemmas, whose counsel did you first turn to?&quot; The Christian will easily and swiftly answer, &quot;Scripture, yours.&quot; The goat, the unknown person, will not be able to say that. They will say a great many things, I imagine, but it will not be that. No, the supposed Christian has forgotten that Christ is both Savior and Lord. What knight of the realm never asks their King for guidance on what to do, and expects to be paid for services rendered? So it goes with Christians, I assume. Take the issue of abortion, for instance. From where have you formed your opinion on the matter? Friends? News articles? Random websites like Facebook posts or Reddit? Perhaps you thought long and hard about the issue and made a decision 'on your own'? This is something all Christians struggle with, I assure you, but every time I find a moral quandary, I strive to first ask, &quot;What has my King said about this matter?&quot;  But I called this an interlude on joy. What have I discussed thus far? God&rsquo;s happiness? The moral benefits of Christianity? False teachers? How to love our neighbor? Succinctly, these are talking about how knowing the truth brings us closer to God, who brings us joy. The fall of barbarism, given that we still have barbaric cultures today, is not guaranteed. The road to joy is likewise lined with people and their creations seeking to turn you aside from God&rsquo;s storehouse and harvest you for their own benefit.   That&rsquo;s a bit preachier than I aim to be here, oh well. Really, this interlude is about the effect of Christianity, actual Christianity, not the people who claim to be one and then command from the gospel of self. We all have a different picture of who that is. In aggregate, it&rsquo;s hard to be a non-believer. Hopelessness, a breakdown of community&#8230; you know, Christianity answers the question, &ldquo;is your neighbor worth loving?&rdquo; It says &ldquo;in all circumstances, yes.&rdquo; (With obvious caveats, the Mongol trying to kill your daughter&#8230; pick up a sword.)  It says you have dignity. It says you should have compassion, and it teaches how. It says you should care, and it models how. And it does this from a place of supreme knowledge of the human condition, and its author has had to endure the worst of our behavior and still come out of it whole.   How many times will you read this in your life: &ldquo;this person grew up religious, but as their faith clashed with their understanding of the outside world&#8230;&rdquo; And on and on. Yes, I&rsquo;m sure it did. The place of darkness often differs from the place of light. &#8195;</p>
