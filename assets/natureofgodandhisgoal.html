<h1>THE NON-ORIGIN AND NATURE OF GOD</h1>

<p>The central question of this first chapter is whether or not the idea of a God is even plausible from the standpoint of reason. That is, does it make sense that there&rsquo;s a God in the first place? It might strike you as odd that I'm starting the book, a book about Christianity, outside of Scripture, expressly away from the Christian God. The first iteration of this book actually had as its first chapter a long study of how we got Scripture, the apocrypha, the early church fathers, and other related matters. But I'd rather start building this out from the lowest level I can. The old first chapter about Scripture had the right idea, if not the right substance: we have to start outside the Bible, because there are a few showstopper attacks on Christianity that, if not answered, make any further discussion useless. This chapter, thus, is a defense of the rationality of there being a single, divine creator of our universe. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you just say in the preface this wasn&rsquo;t an apologetics book, but instead a teaching book?&rdquo; Yes I did, and I think you can learn a lot about a castle by laying siege to it! I don&rsquo;t intend to just argue about bla bla bla metaphysics bla bla bla. My goal is to take you with my on a short journey that may provide some insight into the character of God.  I must warn you: while short, at about 5,000 words, this first section can be a bit dense. (You will never be more perplexed by reading about apples, although I&rsquo;d wager if you&rsquo;ve spent any time in a physics classroom you&rsquo;ll still dread the spherical cow more.) The rest of the book, when dealing with Scripture and specifically the Christian God, is not so heavy into acronyms and formal&not;(ish) logical constructs. There are also a lot of terms that need to be defined here, which also does not really occur in the rest of the book. To that end, if you already find the idea of a God to be entirely plausible, I would rather you skip this chapter than put the book down thinking the whole book is like it. You will miss a connection or finer point or two later on, but I would rather you miss those small bits than the whole book.  With two paragraphs of probably unnecessary pre-apology out of the way, let's dive in. If we are to question whether a god could be the source of all things, we have to figure out what exactly being the 'source of all things' means (and why all things need a source to begin with). How does one get from &lsquo;origin&rsquo; to &lsquo;present?&rsquo; Stated simply, by causes and effects. An apple is caused by a tree, and a tree is caused by a seed (at a high level). If we think of history as a chain of cause and effect, what happens when you grab that chain and follow it all the way back? If you went past the first sharpened stick, past the first star to ignite, what would you find? Before I attempt to answer that, there are three terms that should be defined. The first is literal, absolute nothingness, hereon called literal non-being. No quantum foam, no space, not blackness, literal nothingness. And by the way, you're not supposed to be able to picture it: it's nothing. To make sure this is clear, literal non-being is not even zero, it's nothing. It is not even the database concept of null. Nor is it &ldquo;simply not there.&rdquo; There isn&rsquo;t even a &ldquo;there&rdquo; for nothing to be! &ldquo;Alright, why not just call it nothing then?&rdquo; Because when I say 'nothing', people have all sorts of ideas what that means, like a vacuum, or quantum foam or other such things, and being precise is important. The opposite of literal non-being is what I'll call reality, which is the total area that encompasses where there is 'something.' (Our universe is a subset of reality.) Fairly simple, unlike the third term, which is time. The definition I will use here is this: 'time refers to change.' If there is a change, time has passed. If there is no change, no time has passed. Saying &quot;time didn't exist&quot; is therefore meaningless; time only advances with changes; no change and it is paused, for lack of a better word. Being &quot;outside of time&quot; is also meaningless. You can be unchanging, but saying you are &quot;outside of time&quot; means nothing - what would it mean? You cannot be &quot;outside&quot; of something that has no dimensions (which holds no matter what definition of time you use). That's like saying you're outside of math. Again:  1. Literal non-being is true nothingness.  2. Reality is every thing and phenomena.  3. Time is any change, no matter how minute or small.  Keep those in mind as we continue. For now, though, back to our chain. Does it, or does it not have a first link? Is there an end to this chain? Well, there must be a first link, for a fairly simple reason: the chain couldn't ever get to now, if it goes infinitely far back. Let&rsquo;s say you own a house, and find yourself trapped on the roof. A Quixotic fellow approaches with truckloads of turtles, and offers to build a tower of turtles up to you. He starts at the ground, placing one turtle on top of another. After a while, and confusing a bunch of turtles, ta da! They reach you, and you climb down. Ok, easy enough: now take away the ground. Your house is in the void. There is no way for the turtles to ever reach you, because there is no ground for them to start on, and you&rsquo;d need infinitely many turtles to get to your roof. Said more rigorously, every moment must wait an infinite amount of time to occur, so there is no &quot;now.&quot; Sorta rattles the brain a bit, aye? But that's why time must have a definite beginning. If the past is unbounded, the present could not yet be. Perhaps this is where my mathematics background gets in the way: an infinite is not just a &ldquo;really large number.&rdquo; An infinite is a concept, specifically a reference to something being &ldquo;unbounded.&rdquo; If the past has no bound, it could never reach us, for &ldquo;now&rdquo; would be an unbounded amount of time ago. (I don&rsquo;t think that helped much. Best to stick to the turtles.) What about the idea that it's all a cycle? You hear this in popular science a lot, but it&rsquo;s really just the &ldquo;there is no first link&rdquo; option from above dressed up different. First, time is inherently linear. If at T=1 there is a red apple, and at T=2 it becomes blue, and at T=3 it becomes red again, that is a &quot;cycle&quot; but time is still advancing. Just because you cannot distinguish between time steps, or even groups of time steps, does not mean time is not advancing. Time always advances forward, as, remember, it is just change. Changes come one after another. Time moves forward. The cycle started somewhere, as there is a &quot;now.&quot; How can I say that? If the cycle did not start somewhere, what does that mean? You guessed it: we have the same problem as there being no first link. Every single action has an infinite history. Infinity and reality do not play nicely. Since that means the cycle started somehow, and isn't a true circle anyway, this idea falls apart quickly as well. Since we are experiencing a now, we can be assured there is a first link, anchoring the chain in the winds of eternity. Let's call that link the First Cause.  Something, reality in general, cannot come from literal non-being. There is no way for a stable reality to exist if this is possible, as literal non-being has no attributes, so &quot;it&quot; cannot cause, and if &quot;it&quot; could, &quot;it&quot; would always be doing so. Thus, the first link in the chain, the First Cause, did not 'pop' into existence from literal non-being. Likewise, we know the First Cause cannot have caused itself; this is an obvious contradiction, as it would have existed before it existed in order to do that, which is impossible. And to state the obvious, it was first, so there was nothing else to have caused it. If you look around the room, then, you're left with one possibility that causes no contradiction: the First Cause was causeless. Since there was nothing else aside from it, something cannot come from literal non-being, and it causing itself is a logical impossibility&#8230; there is no viable explanation aside from it being causeless. This holds regardless of your leaning, theist or atheist or anythingist. So our First Cause rather quickly changes into the Causeless First Cause (CFC). Of course, we all now want to learn about the CFC. What was it? What can we possibly know about it? Fortunately, there is one tool we can use to do so: the contradiction. Even describing a time when literally nothing but the CFC was, the contradiction will still be useful. Mind, there were no physics, no set of governing rules. A contradiction, though, is a gold plated guarantee that something is impossible. If I say &quot;I was in my house at 10 am,&quot; but someone tells you I was most certainly driving my car at 10 am, you know there is a falsehood present, as both cannot be true (movie style time travel shenanigans or 'your house is your car' riddle solutions &ndash; don't torture the analogy). Whenever a contradiction appears, it means you have guaranteed that there is at least one falsehood.  The first question that needs answering is: why should a Causeless First Cause exist at all? This stumped me for a long time, until I realized: the only way the CFC could exist, is if it would be a contradiction for it to not. Chew on that idea for a moment, it's a very foreign idea. It would be a contradiction for the CFC to not exist. There is no other explanation for a causeless entity to exist.  Let me make sure you don't get the wrong idea here. I once thought that perhaps the best argument starts in the opposite direction; that there is nothing that could prevent the CFC from existing, and so it does. However the flaw in this reasoning is quite subtle; it winds up pre-supposing the existence of the CFC, much like Descartes' ontological argument. In order to &quot;prevent&quot; a thing from existing, the concept of it must already exist, no? And with nothing but pure, literal non-being&#8230; there are no concepts of things. Second, you cannot argue &quot;since it's causeless, it must exist as it has no cause, there's your positive contradiction.&quot; This has the same presupposition problem (causelessness is an attribute, and the causelessness of a thing cannot exist before the thing itself), and also opens you up to issues like &quot;why aren't there infinite copies of the CFC?&quot;  &quot;Isn't that a cause, though? That it would be a contradiction?&quot; Not really, this is much too into semantics for my taste, but let me reiterate: there is nothing checking whether contradictions are occurring and fixing them. They simply are not by their nature. I cannot be in the car and be at home watching tv at the same time. It's not necessary for anything to &quot;enforce&quot; that. Apply that concept to the positive contradiction of the CFC. It simply is.  I have no analogy for you, and there truthfully cannot be one: the CFC would be the literal only thing for which this is the case, that a contradiction is caused by it not existing. Again, nothing enforces contradictions, like the structure of our universe enforces the laws of physics. (Negative) contradictions are not. The positive contradiction is.  Someone said of the above: &quot;Alright alright, there's a first link in the chain of cause and effect from now back all the way. That first link is causeless, and is by way of contradiction. I'm not sure why you bothered establishing a reason (or cause) for something you defined as causeless to exist, but sure. I assume at some point we're going to see how this gets to God's viability? Obviously you're setting up for the CFC to be God, but how?&quot;  A note on this: calling the contradiction bit a 'reason' or 'cause' for the CFC is a misunderstanding of the idea. Like I said, contradictions are not enforced nor do any work. They don't cause or uncause or ride bicycles. So I didn't provide a reason for the CFC's being, I provided an explanation of what being causeless must mean, which will become important in a moment. The latter part of the question is correct, though! I'm going to use the previous discussion as a way to learn some traits about the CFC. As I go through these traits, you'll probably notice that we're inching ever closer to God. My intent is not to discount other such CFCs, such as perhaps the primordial singularity that caused the theorized big bang, but to demonstrate the possibility of God as the CFC. Remember, no matter which you adhere to, God, god, gods, or none, what I've said thus far still applies. Let's find something concrete. We know one trait of the CFC for certain: the fact that you and I and everything else besides exists, and this is critically important, means the CFC must have had the ability to cause effects. It was, after all, the first cause - this implies it could have effects. If you allow me to shorthand some thinking, following that idea through a step more gives us this:</p>

<p>1. It must have the ability to cause effects (changes, advances in time, etc.) 2. It must have either: a. had the ability to create from literal non-being b. contained all that would be and is within itself, and had the ability to alter it</p>

<p>This seems reasonable, yes? Given that it can cause change, it must possess one of two abilities: the ability to bring things from literal non-being, or the ability to alter itself. There's no other way for the CFC to cause things; again, it is utterly alone. But let's examine 2B a bit more closely to see if it holds up. (Spoiler, it doesn&rsquo;t.) If we allow for 2B, then that means the CFC is changeable. However, this cannot be the case. The CFC must exist or a contradiction would be caused. That means that everything about the CFC is a result of that idea as well, and if it could alter itself, then whatever it altered must not cause a contradiction if it is changed, so that must not be a part of the positive contradiction, and would not have ever been. This eliminates the possibility that the CFC can change. It and all its attributes must be or else they would not be.  Anyway, that leaves us with 2A: that it can create from literal non-being. Now, I know I spent a great deal of time on the impossibility of things coming from literal non-being in the footnotes and body, but that was without any other input. There is no contradiction in something being brought forth from literal non-being by some reason other than itself. 2A doesn't cause any contradictions. 2A does of course run afoul of our understanding of our universe&rsquo;s physics, that much is certain, but the laws of physics are curious consequences or deliberate underpinnings of the structure of our universe, and when it was just the CFC&#8230; none of that was there. So let's see our revised list of required traits for the CFC, that come as a consequence of this section:</p>

<p>1. It must have the ability to cause change 2. It must have had the ability to create from literal non-being 3. It must be: a. Purely that which is required by positive contradiction b. Unchanging</p>

<p>But what are the limits on 3B, unchanging? Even in Scripture, the Christian God does things. Is movement a change? Is speaking a change? Not of a trait or part of the CFC. Traits here are intrinsic qualities of form. An example of an intrinsic quality of form is say, that a square has exactly four ninety-degree internal angles. You are not altering the qualities of a square by moving it around, nor is a change in the definition of a square caused by rotating it.  To me, this list is as fleshed out as it can be. Much beyond these, and you start making guesses or the number of options balloons too high, in terms of trying to nail down what must be true about the CFC. We can discuss candidates that do not violate these conditions that might be the CFC, though. As this is a chapter about God from reason, let's consider an aware CFC. I will not be arguing here for why an aware CFC is the only option; that's not the purpose of this chapter, and I&rsquo;m not sure you can even argue that. I will leave a few brief points on the matter of the big bang, and perhaps the most foundational, unanswered question I raise on the topic, in a footnote for the curious. My argument is that an aware CFC is simply an option, as it violates none of the conditions above, as far as I can discern.  An aware, as in, sentient CFC, though, to return to the point, can certainly cause change, as it has will. An aware entity can wield, as in control and apply, the power to create from nothing. What after that, though? The basic premise is viable, but I want to follow the logic a bit farther along the branch of the CFC being aware. Some surprising things fall out as we crank the machine.  For instance, the CFC must be omnipotent, as in, having no limits to its power. I'll define omnipotence literally as &quot;being able to do everything that is possible.&quot; How do I know that? Well, what would cause those limits? There was no physics yet, when there was but one link in the chain. It doesn't change when it acts, so it doesn't require fuel, and it can create from literal non-being. That's all the potential sources of limitation other than intrinsic, meaning it must be omnipotent barring intrinsic limitations that we can't discover or know. Said again, if it can create from literal non-being, and can't change or be reduced on its own, it must be able to bring forth anything it wants without fuel or energy expenditure. This must be true, as it could cause, and there was no fuel laying around for it to cause with, so it must not have needed any. Look at this another way: its definition states it is unchanging, yet can act. That means that to act, it does not need to expend energy, and if it need not expend any energy to act, and there are no laws of physics or the like over it&#8230; its power is thus maximal. What would it expend? Every component of it is necessary. Alright, so the CFC would reasonably be omnipotent.  Back to the aware CFC, though. What about the character of such an aware CFC, henceforth called god (the little g is purposeful)? We find ourselves at another branching point of consideration. This god would either be a random actor or a patterned actor. I am purposefully going to arbitrarily exclude the random actor, because if we assume god is not random, we can derive some fascinating items about his character. The random actor would, of course, create a never-ending stream of random things from literal non-being at a perfectly random interval. We're going to continue as if that were not the case. (It could be, though; our universe could simply have been randomly created by the perfectly random god.) But what does non-random mean? It means pattern-having. To an aware being, following a pattern means having a will.  All 'will' refers to here is that this god follows some pattern by which it uses its power. (Not that it must follow any specific pattern by nature, but more that it is a follower of pattern(s).) That means that a fundamental component of the god CFC is order - patterns require order, after all.  Since the non-random god is ordered, and we know it must be creative (otherwise nothing would exist)&#8230; what else can we derive? There's an uncountable number of potential patterns this god could follow, right? I've asked myself: &quot;what pattern does our non-random god choose to follow? We can't know that. It could be an Odin-esque pattern: create things, then let them kill each other for his amusement.&quot; But the answer is in the question. Choice. Our non-random god makes choices. Non-random choice implies preference. And in the absence of external influences, what can be the only determinant of his preferences, if they are not random? His own fundamental nature, or self (perhaps his 'imagination,' but that would still be self-derived). So god's own nature of being ordered and creative influences his preferences, and god's preferences influence what he defines as good and thus what he does: order and creation. The traits we commonly associate with goodness necessarily promote order and creation, and those are precisely the traits the specific God this book focuses on exhibits in his nature.  That is the last insight I believe reason can give us, or needs to give us. There's no reason the CFC would or would not have been a mind (or aware), and since I'm not particularly making an argument of necessity but possibility, that's fine. The branches of what could be, from what must be, do not exclude, and somewhat encouragingly seem to promote, an ordered, creative CFC, if you start along the right branch. Which neatly lines up with the Christian God's priorities, of course: creation and order.  For fun, I asked chatGPT to try and refute my arguments. It said the following: 1. Assumptions about causality: The author assumes that everything in the universe follows a cause-and-effect relationship, and therefore, there must be a First Cause. However, this assumption is based on our observations and experiences within the universe, and it may not necessarily apply to the origin of the universe itself. 2. Jumping to a specific conclusion: The author concludes that the causeless First Cause must be a God or divine creator. While the argument may establish the plausibility of a causeless First Cause, it doesn't necessarily lead to the conclusion of a specific deity. It's a leap to attribute specific characteristics or intentions to this First Cause without further evidence or logical reasoning. 3. Limited understanding of non-being: The author argues that the causeless First Cause cannot come from literal non-being. However, our understanding of non-being or nothingness is limited, and it's difficult to make definitive claims about its properties or limitations. 4. Equating positive contradiction with a divine nature: The author suggests that the causeless First Cause must be purely that which is required by positive contradiction. While this may be an interesting philosophical concept, it doesn't necessarily imply a divine nature or attributes typically associated with gods. 5. Alternative explanations: The author's argument assumes that a causeless First Cause is the only plausible explanation for the existence of the universe. However, there are alternative cosmological theories and hypotheses, such as multiverse theories or quantum fluctuations, that propose different explanations for the origin of the universe without invoking a causeless First Cause.</p>

<p>&#8230;Unimpressive, I have to say. I literally say that 2 and 5 aren't what I'm doing &ndash; I only argue that a divine creator could fit the bill and follow the reasoning for if it were. Tsk tsk. 4 is essentially the same thing. I never said it did imply divine attributes, but it does not preclude them either. Ok, so what about 1 and 3? Well, chatGPT kinda fumbles with 3: literal non-being can have no properties. That's the whole point. Oops. 1 is chatGPT's best point, actually, but I don't say everything follows a cause-effect relationship, namely, the CFC must be causeless. I in fact did not, though, prove that there must have been only one CFC, I dimly recall discarding the notion of multiple CFCs spawning an &quot;orchard&quot; of cause-and-effect chains that either do or do not interact or intersect in a footnote. The issue is, though, if there were multiple CFCs past one, we suddenly have a problem. If there can be more than one CFC, then there can be any number of them, as mutual exclusion would not be not part of its/their nature by necessity.  And if the CFC must exist by positive contradiction, and there must be more than one, there would be more than one, and then there would likely be an infinite number of them. Then you have branches dealing with infinite identical CFCs or infinite variable CFCs and branches from there splitting on whether or not they interact and suddenly you're very confused. (I'm pretty sure, also, that you can dismiss &quot;infinite potentially interacting CFCs&quot; out of hand: if they could interact with any probability, and there were an infinite number of them, then every single moment our universe's cause and effect chain would be interacted with by another CFC's cause and effect chain. Why is very simply math that I leave for you to puzzle out in half a minute.)  It seems more plausible to me that there would be exactly one CFC, no more, no less, but I readily admit intuition is not much help in this realm. So I will grant 1 to chatGPT, sort of. I never said everything had a cause, quite the opposite, at least one thing violates cause and effect. Nor does my argument hinge upon everything but one thing having a cause: it hinges upon our present reality being at the end of a chain of cause and effect. But again, my point was not to dismiss other concepts of the CFC, simply to demonstrate that there exists a rational, non-contradictory example of the CFC that we would call god, and could recognize as something like the Christian God. To progress, though, I believe it is time to turn to the Scriptures, to see what I view as the aware CFC. Who is God?  &#8195;</p>

<h1>THE BIBLICAL GOD, HIS GOAL, AND CREATION</h1>

<p>The book now shifts to a discussion about the viability of and non-contradictory nature of the Christian God specifically. If you followed my recommendation and skipped the first chapter, I will summarize it, without defense to keep it light, like so: If time is a chain of cause and effect, at some point there was and must have been a first cause which had no cause itself. That first cause could only exist by way of positive contradiction, meaning that while negative contradictions must not be, the first cause must be. It could not change, and it could create from literal non-being. Given that, it would necessarily be omnipotent as it needs no fuel and expends no energy to create from nothing. If such a first cause were a self-aware, thinking being, and not a purely random actor, it would have to derive what it wanted from itself. Given that its primary traits are that it can create things, it would value that trait highly. If we again assume it is non-random, then it follows a pattern, and patterns are a kind of order, and we see how such a being could quite conceivably desire creation and order. The Christian God is a being that enjoys creation and order, and we see how he is not excluded from existence by reason. Phew. This chapter begins with a description of the nature of God, but quickly move on to his goal and what he wants. I do, though, have to make one last remark concerning this and following sections: given that I am after the internal consistency and reasonability of and lack of contradictions in the Bible, I must take at face value that what it says is true. I don't feel like prefacing every single quote from Scripture with, &quot;if Christianity is true.&quot; There are portions of the book where I do not take this for granted; those times are when not doing so matters because I'm defending something other than internal consistency. Again, I don't do this at times that I am attempting to make an outward argument, of course, as then I'd get emails about my fallacious reasoning and all that.  One last general note, I have a tendency here, and I think oftentimes many people can do this accidentally, to describe God and his motives and so on and the person behind it all gets lost. God is a person. He may be able to create a trillion trillion stars that'll cook you from ten million miles away and blind you yet farther still, but he is not a force, he is not an abstract concept or a corpse to be dissected. He lives and he is complete and he speaks. (If Christianity is true, of course.) And God has spoken to us through Scripture. It seems fairly obvious, then, that he would have told us something about himself within it. So, what has he told us? Well, why not start with form, and then move on to personality? After all, when describing aliens in books, characters often start with &ldquo;big meaty claws&rdquo; and then &ldquo;it tried to kill us all!&rdquo; At the highest level, he's said that there is a Holy Spirit. There is a Father. And there is a Son. Some call these three the Trinity, some recoil at the mere use of that word. I have no preference for terms; Scripture tells us, as I said, that there is a Father, there is a Son, and there is the Holy Spirit. Each member of the Trinity is God. The Father is God (Romans 1:7). The Son is God (Romans 9:5, John 10:30-33). The Holy Spirit is God (1 Corinthians 3:16). The Son, who we know as Jesus, is interestingly called 'the Word' as well, in John 1:1, which lays out this separate-but-one logic as well: &quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is an example, from Matthew 3:16-17, where all three act independently of one another:  &quot;As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, &quot;This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.&quot;</p>

<p>Here we see Jesus on the ground, we see the Holy Spirit coming down onto Jesus, and we hear the Father in heaven. Three entities. But how do we know they're truly distinct, and not just one in multiple places? For one, the Father and Son are distinct, as the Father has information the Son does not (Matthew 24:36): &quot;But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.&quot;</p>

<p>Further, in Genesis 1:26, God uses the word &quot;our&quot; - plural. There are plenty of places in the Psalms where plural and singular references are used together as well. This is often hard to grasp, and indeed the exact way it works for God is certainly impossible for us to comprehend (or else he probably would not be God). I used to have some explanation here about &quot;centers of awareness&quot; and such that&#8230; just, even if it was helpful, isn't necessary. I see no point to trying to comprehend the mechanics or nature of God&rsquo;s form. There are three persons in one and they share one overall will; that&rsquo;s what we are shown and told. I know you're probably wondering why the guy who spent a whole chapter trying to tease out details about God from reason isn't trying to understand this better, but you must also recognize: I knew when to stop! Trying to fit God's mechanics in my head is like an ant trying to probe a neutron star with pheromones. Consider: the electromagnetic radiation we know of as light that our eyes detect and our brain processes, is a created thing. You couldn't even see God if he didn't reveal himself with what our eyes can see. Anyways, onwards to things we can comprehend. So, high level. What else do we know about God? Well, how about his name? God has many names or titles, used at different times. I am a firm believer that you are what you do, and so I must state at the outset, for the majority of these names and titles, they are given in response to something God had done, was doing, or would do. Of course, the most famous of these will be the one he gave in answer to this very question: &quot;I am who I am.&quot; Yahweh. Let's see some of the others, though, rapid-fire. You may notice a few themes among them. 1. El Elyon, God most high, the most exalted, or &quot;God the Sovereign.&quot;  2. El Shaddai, God Almighty, God of all power. 3. Adonai, Lord, used in place of Yahweh, sometimes when God deals with gentiles. The transcendent God. 4. Yahweh-Jireh, the Lord will provide.  5. Yahweh-Rapha, the Lord who heals. 6. El Roi, the Lord who sees. He sees us. He hears us. He is mindful of us. 7. El-Olam, God everlasting, &quot;from everlasting to everlasting you are God.&quot; An Alpha and Omega title. 8. Jehovah-Nissi, the Lord our banner. This one is slightly harder to define; it is from the story where as Moses held his rod aloft, the Israelites were winning their battle, and when he let it down, they began to lose. Perhaps it would thus be helpful to render it &quot;The Lord, our banner, who we look to, who gives us strength.&quot; 9. Jehovah-M'Kaddesh, the Lord who sanctifies you. To sanctify is to make clean, or pure, or holy. Moses uses the same word to describe what God did with the Sabbath, the holy day, the day of rest, the day of completion, in Genesis 2:3.  10. Yahweh-Sidqenu, the Lord our righteousness. I feel it necessary to point out this one is from Jeremiah (33:16), and if you want to feel convicted of your sin, this is the book to read. There's an endless pronouncement of judgement followed by hope. I point that out, because the 'our' is incredibly important here. As Isaiah the prophet suddenly understood when he saw God in his vision, mankind is defined at present by our rebellion and sin. We do not have any righteousness apart from that given to us by God. Thus, this title has ramifications far beyond enlightening us about God's character as righteous and the fountain of righteousness. Do you know what God is talking about when he gives this name? He is talking about Christ, the righteous branch of David. I must, though, continue and leave the ocean of depth in this name for another time.  11. Yahweh-Shalom, the Lord is Peace. Shalom is a concept that doesn't quite fit into our conception of the word &quot;peace.&quot; Shalom is not just a cessation of conflict, or pleasant quiet. It is a condition of togetherness with God and a condition of permanent well-being. As with Christ, peace often means between man and God foremost, between human and human secondarily. 12. Yahweh-Elohim, Lord God, Lord of Lords, ruler of all authorities. An &quot;every knee will bow&quot; type title. 13. Jehovah-Shammah, the Lord is There. God has a personal presence with us, in us. As we are temples, so this title was announced at the time God's presence had returned to the Jewish Temple (Ezekiel 48). But you know what? There's something else about this. When I think of God, I often start with him sitting somewhere 'above' the universe (if that word means anything outside a gravity well), and he reaches down through the cosmos to our rebellious mudball of a world to interact with us. But that's not the case as presented by this name; no, he is here. The same guy who made magnetars that'll rip you apart at the molecular level, who shines seven times brighter than the noon Sun, is actively present.  14. Yahweh-Rohi, The Lord our Shepherd. A shepherd defends his flock, his flock knows his voice, a shepherd leads them to green pastures. &quot;The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.&quot; 15. Yahweh-Saboath, The Lord of Hosts. One could think of a &quot;Host&quot; as a concentration of power, in its most abstract. Often it means &quot;army,&quot; for a simple representation of power. The meaning is clear; God commands all power, and all powers are his.  16. El-Gibhor, Mighty God. I have saved this one for last, it comes from Isaiah 9:6, and is prophetically speaking of Christ. It says Christ will be called: &quot;Wonderful Counselor [a wonder of a counselor], Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince [in the sense of 'administrator'] of Peace.&quot; These give Christ his qualifications for ruling, his strength, his relationship with us, and the society he administers. He will have pele, or 'supernatural' in the sense of 'far above human' wisdom. Father references concern, care, and discipline. Peace here is salem, meaning wholeness, completeness. I feel it worth noting, in verse 7, it is said &quot;The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.&quot; God guarantees this future with his absolute commitment and absolute power.</p>

<p>What a very technical list of names! And, frankly, a bit boring, right? I mean I almost feel, reading it back, as if I&rsquo;m a noble at court listening to the listed titles of the King as he walks to his throne. You are what you have done, as they say. And I cannot help but mention, either, the many perceptions of the Christian God that exist out there. You can walk the streets of a city and get every possible range of opinion: &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a baby killing tyrant that doesn&rsquo;t care&rdquo; to &ldquo;he is nothing but pure cozy love!&rdquo; These we will interrogate and find out their truth in the coming pages. As presented in Scripture and creation, God is terrifying, yet a sweet comforter; a warrior King who crushes evil, and a perfect maternal figure who covers his children like a great bird; someone who will, once they&rsquo;ve spoken, never go back on their word; a judge, a lawgiver, a guide, an artist of all passions and mediums, an engineer on both scales atomic and cosmic; perfect father, mother, Lord, savior. This section must feel weak, because written word is insufficient to capture such a personality. I say these things in no attempt to convince you of their truth, merely that this is the person the Scriptures attempt to convey the doings and sayings of. The last thing I wish to note in this brief introduction to God is the following, Isaiah 6:2-3. Now, something to note about Hebrew, repetition indicates not 'severity' or 'exclamation,' but here is an example. When a Hebrew speaker says &quot;pit pit&quot;, they mean the deepest, darkest pit they've ever come across; it is the most pit-like pit. English speaking children may jokingly say something like, &quot;that's the duckiest duck to ever duck,&quot; speaking of a duck doing all the quintessential duck behaviors and quacking and the like. Only one of God's traits is repeated to the third, his holiness. Let&rsquo;s call this idea a &ldquo;plural of amplitude.&rdquo; &quot;Above him were seraphim &#8230; And they were calling to one another: 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p> What exactly is holiness? I have something of a fear that this is partially like trying to differentiate blue and red to a blind man. Blue is simply blue and red is simply red, and unless you've experienced both you can't really grasp it. I can say all day long that blue light has more energy than red, that water is blue, that the sky is blue, that apples are red, but the blind man simply will not get a picture of red and blue in his head. He cannot.  I, as I write this, feel like I at best have severe cataracts and can merely see hints of red and blue. It seems to me to be like this: I have heard people say they&rsquo;ve spent &ldquo;a lifetime&rdquo; on something, and when I was younger this made no impression on me. But as I&rsquo;ve gotten older, I can more sweepingly grasp the actual amount of time and effort this means was put into it, and yet I reckon I will not be able to fully understand it until I too have spent a lifetime with my arms bent to a task. So is holiness, in majority: the experience of it cannot be explained in written word, though its relevance can probably be sufficiently captured. Jesus was called the Holy one of God, Israel was called to be holy. If you google holiness, you'll get plenty of articles describing it as being set apart from sin, righteous. But I reject such a definition, parroted from a superficial pondering. No character trait of God is defined by rebellion against him; that would be senseless and contradict his individual origin and oneness, his self-sufficiency. Holiness is something special, set apart, unique: but what does that mean? Holiness is directly related to who he is, and to fully answer that, we must know what God wants. By looking at what God wants, we will know him and his holiness far better.  So, what does God want? For all the people I see trying to find an answer to this question, it may come as a shock that he tells us in a pretty point-blank fashion. Colossians 1:16: &quot;For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him.&quot;</p>

<p> Romans 11:36: &quot;For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.&quot;</p>

<p>John 8:50, Jesus speaking: &quot;I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>These verses, and many others, tell us that God created everything there is for his own glory. This fits with what we established through reason. He bases what is good off his own fundamental nature, so it makes sense that he would be acting in his own interest. What does that mean, though: &quot;glory&quot;? How does that fit in with a God that foundationally pursues order, creation, and community? When I think of God seeking &quot;glory&quot; as his primary goal, well, I think more of a conqueror chasing victory on the battlefield. That doesn't feel divine, does it? Honestly, this spawns more questions than it answers. The two that are the most important are:  1. Why does he want glory?  2. What is glory to God?</p>

<p>The verses above leave this part a bit ambiguous, and to confuse matters more, God can manifest his glory in Scripture, generally as a fire or intense light of some kind. How on earth is &quot;glory&quot; even a physical thing? Why fire and light? Imagine if I showed you a painting of a lightning bolt, and you'd never seen one before in real life; you would be forgiven for thinking they were stationary, brilliant trees of some kind. It would never occur to you that they darted from sky to earth with a thunderclap and vanished faster than you can blink. So these descriptions of the fiery cloud and the like, while revealing in some fashion, don't answer the questions we're after, and can actually lead us down the wrong path (at first). I spent a long while trying to figure out what his glory was, until I realized that I was going about this backwards. The better order to figuring this issue out, is to first find out why he wants this &quot;glory&quot; that can be manifested as a fire. That is where we will find our clues as to what it really is, this thing so precious that God would want it.  Even so, during my search for why God would want it, I was under the influence of the human definition of glory, thinking of someone like Caesar, chasing glory on the battlefield, to the chanting and praise of his countrymen. That's the sort of thing we picture when we think of glory. And in no uncertain terms, that sort of glory is also the Lord's, but it is not the glory of the Lord. Isaiah 42:8 actually separates these two types of glory: &quot;I am the Lord; that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to carved idols.&quot;</p>

<p>If you step back from the human idea of glory, you realize that Scripture isn't just telling us God wants glory; but that he deserves it, it's his. To elaborate on what I mean by deserve, take these facts: 1. God is morally perfect, or has the maximum moral estimation (under his morality, which is the only one that matters when you&rsquo;re omnipotent) 2. God is maximally valuable (what could be worth more than God?)</p>

<p>Since he sets the morality for the universe, he will rather obviously be the most morally perfect entity within it (see Special Article H). Further, he is God, and it should not be objectionable that he is the most valuable entity as well (this follows fairly easily from reason as he is both omnipotent and omniscient, creator and ruler of all; Philippians 3:8 somewhat points to this).  It would be a lie and an imperfect judgement for God to not value himself appropriately, as in maximally, and it would be unjust for him to not treat himself precisely as he deserves. After all, he claims he is perfectly just (Job 8:3, 9:19, 34:12, Psalm 50:6, 97:2, Romans 2:11, Psalm 7:11, among others).  For scriptural sources of this 'deserving' idea, see here (1 Chronicles 16:28-29): &quot;&#8230;ascribe to the Lord glory and strength! Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name; bring an offering and come before him! Worship the Lord in the splendor of holiness;&quot;</p>

<p>This also further separates God's glory from Caesar's: Caesar is fighting to earn his glory, God is seeing that he receives the glory he is owed. Also, our Caesar is selfishly seeking his, he does not wish to share it; God happily shares it with his community, including us, which I'll get to more in a minute. Another reason it is not selfish: God deserves this thing, and getting what you rightfully deserve is not selfish.  The reason why he seeks it is that it is his rightful due, and to carry out his claimed perfect justice, he must receive what he is due. So we know the why, but not the what. What is glory? What could possibly be good enough for an omnipotent creator? If he values himself maximally, he merits a maximum reward. Said differently, he who is the best, deserves the best. Well, strangely enough, only one thing fits that essential criteria. Himself! Is God's glory himself, his own being? God is unchanging (Malachi 3:6 etc.) and he's maximally powerful, or omnipotent. Therefore, we know: 1. He must have already received in full what he deserves, as there is nothing that could prevent him from receiving it. 2. It must have existed with him since the beginning of time, as he is unchanging.</p>

<p> If he is unchanging and has always been satisfied, since at one point he was all there was (Revelation 22:13) then what he deserves must have been there with him: looking around the room, that just leaves himself. Psalm 26:8 (literal translation from Alec Motyer): &quot;O Lord, I love the [dwellingplace] of your house, the place of the abode of your glory.&quot;</p>

<p>A wrinkle, though: the Bible says God receives glory from his creations. We have verses like this, where Jesus says the following (John 17:10), among others:  &quot;And glory has come to me through them.&quot;</p>

<p>Isaiah 48:9-11: &quot;For my name's sake I defer my anger; for the sake of my praise I restrain it for you, that I may not cut you off. &#8230; For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it, for how should my name be profaned? My glory I will not give to another.&quot;</p>

<p>Isaiah 43:6-7: &quot;&#8230;bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the end of the earth, everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made.&quot;</p>

<p>Isaiah 49:3: &quot;And he said to me, 'You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.'&quot;</p>

<p>2 Timothy 4:18:  &quot;The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.&quot;</p>

<p>Revelation 1:5-6: &quot;To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.&quot;</p>

<p>Psalm 115:1: &quot;Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to your name give glory, for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness!&quot;</p>

<p>You get the point. How do we reconcile the idea of God's self-sufficiency with these and other verses? Quite simply, actually. Genesis 1:27: &quot;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.&quot;</p>

<p>See the Apostle Paul saying this in 2 Corinthians 3:18: &quot;And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.&quot;</p>

<p>And again here in Philippians 1:10-11: &quot;so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.&quot;</p>

<p>And once more, in John 15:7-8: &quot; If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.&quot;</p>

<p>The following excerpts demonstrate that all the glory we have to give back to God, came from God. God isn't getting anything from us he didn't give us to begin with. He's seeing his own reflection, he's receiving back the gift he gave us. Psalm 22:23-25 tells us that the very praise we are commanded to give to the Lord, comes from him: &quot;You who fear the Lord, praise him! &#8230; From you comes my praise in the great congregation&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>See first Isaiah 6:2-3 for a clear scriptural reference to his glory being in creation: &quot;Above him stood the seraphim. &#8230; And one called to another and said: 'Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!'&quot;</p>

<p>And 2 Thessalonians 1:10-12: &quot;when he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at among all who have believed, &#8230; To this end we always pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by his power, so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him &#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>In that sense, God's glory is his self, and self-worth, and self-evaluation (Exodus 13:21 paired with Isaiah 4:5 also equates the Lord with his glory). This is almost exactly what holiness is as well, and why God can be holy without an 'other'. To be clear, I don't think we can fully understand it. In its very essence, it is divine, and I think all we can do is describe it like one would, to re-use a metaphor, describe color to a blind man. He may academically understand color, but will never be able to fully comprehend or behold it. (We will behold him in his glory after our deaths, though.) Despite this limitation, we can still question the particulars, much like the blind man can ask if blue is cooler than red. The first question this blind man asks is, &quot;Why did God give us any of his glory only for it to be reflected back to him?&quot;  God does not need to have one objective. There's no reason he can't have multiple objectives. If he has given us some of himself in some form or fashion, then when he does something that benefits us, it still benefits him. I'm going to use his love of justice (Isaiah 61:8) as an example to clarify and expand that point. 1 Corinthians 8:6 tells us God is the source of all things: &quot;yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.&quot;</p>

<p>Therefore, when we act justly, or display justice, we are displaying something we got from God. He is still esteeming himself when he esteems a human displaying one of his traits. When he called David &quot;a man after my heart,&quot; (Acts 13:22) he was praising himself, for he created David, he is the reason David could display devotion to God, and God was the very object of the praise and of David's devotion; God was worth devoting himself to. Another example would of course be Jesus, who will be eternally gloried because (in part, the part I am focusing on) he followed God's commands to the letter and followed their spirit perfectly (Philippians 2:5-11, among others). Indeed, for Christians, the whole goal is to become more Christlike, which is more godly (Colossians 3, 2 Thessalonians 1:11-12, among others). So God can, and does, value us displaying his traits. But that doesn't answer the question, not fully. Why did he bother creating us at all? Why create anything? We exist, therefore there must have been a reason. Chew on that for a moment. If God gained literally nothing from making us, if he had no reason, he would not have done so. He could have just displayed his traits to his own community of three for all eternity, yet he didn't. Why? Certainly, there&rsquo;s verses such as Psalm 28:9 that tell us we&rsquo;re his inheritance: &ldquo;Oh do save your people, and bless your inheritance. Shepherd them, and carry them for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Jeremiah 13:11 is quite theologically rich in this regard: &ldquo;For as the loincloth clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, declares the Lord, that they might be for me a people, a name, a praise, and a glory, but they would not listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But 1 John 4:7-8 may have a stronger clue as to the chief reason for us: &quot;Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.&quot;</p>

<p>Pair that with 1 Corinthians 13:5: &quot;[Love] does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>If a characteristic of love is defined as not being self-seeking, then God must necessarily seek out an 'other' of some sort. The verses from 1 John tell us that God is indeed love, and is the source of love. He also lives this out by giving us the best gift possible: himself! What gift could possibly be worth more than God? (Psalm 16:11 hints at this but I have previously established the ultimate worth of God.) You see, if he denied his own maximum self-worth, he would then give us an inferior gift; something that was not himself. But as it is, we can experience the fullness of God precisely because he knows what he is worth, and gives us himself joyfully.  Why does love matter? Love is a critical component of God, because he is a community unto himself. What holds a community together better than love? I don't mean that in a sappy Hollywood way: devotion to, and a desire to be close to, the other members of a community are the best way to preserve that community. So it makes sense that God, who professes to be a perfect community, would be no stranger to the ideal way to maintain one. That brings us back to why God created anything at all. Let's get one thing straight: we know that God is pursuing something with the creation of our universe, otherwise, he wouldn't have made it. So, if the Christian God made the universe, he must gain something through it, or otherwise have a reason that advances his goal(s). That is not to say he is somehow not self-sufficient. But no one can deny that if God were totally and completely satisfied by himself, then the universe would not exist. Psalm 104:31: &quot;May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in his works&quot;</p>

<p>Clearly, he derives joy from his creations (when they are very good as in Genesis, that is). But I don't feel that we've arrived at the full answer for why he bothered to create anything just yet. Another facet of his nature inclines him to want creation to exist. He also didn't manifest it in his desired end state from the beginning, so he is willing to wait patiently and to receive what he wants from creation piecemeal. (Of course, it also could be that creation had to go through multiple states in order for him to fully receive what he wanted, but we're getting there!)  We should return to the manifestations of God's glory that we see in Scripture. Remember, it's always as a light or a fire. That actually gives us a fairly strong clue. Turn to these verses: 1 John 1:5: &quot;This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.&quot;</p>

<p>Proverbs 4:18: &quot;But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day.&quot;</p>

<p>Philippians 2:15: &quot;that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,&quot;</p>

<p>John 8:12: &quot;Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, 'I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.'&quot;</p>

<p>Matthew 5:14-16 is possibly the most obvious of these: &quot;You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.&quot;</p>

<p>So the metaphor of darkness and light seems obvious to us&#8230; but why? Why is darkness associated with evil and light with good? Well, what does light do? It radiates, it warms, it illuminates. Darkness is the opposite. In these verses, we see Scripture telling us that it is a fundamental part of God's nature to want to spread his traits, to shine, in a manner of speaking. There are many other verses, such as Isaiah 9:2, John 1:9, 1 Thessalonians 5:5&#8230; but these ones sufficiently capture the idea. The light we have received from God is indicative of its, and thus his, purpose. It is part of him to radiate. When I said that God would necessarily value creation in the first 'chapter', we see that in full form now. I didn't even have the Christian God in mind when I wrote that section, not consciously at least; it has merely fallen into place. He values the act of creation, and he literally pours himself into it. And to make the best creation possible, he had to put himself into it - literally. The column of fire, being God's glory, which is God, makes much more sense now. His spirit being a light over the waters of the great deep also makes more sense. God's holiness purifies, and his glory shines.  So, he created the world in order that he might radiate his perfection in it, and glorify himself through it reflecting his glory back to him. He finds joy in creation, in himself. By doing something for us, he is really doing something for himself, even as we benefit. His love and light, perfectly expressed.  The narrative does not end there, though. God&rsquo;s chosen people are called his &ldquo;inheritance&rdquo; in Scripture, and as we know, human beings haven&rsquo;t exactly sought to fulfill their true purpose, to reflect him as image bearers, with our whole selves often or ever.  &#8195;</p>
