<h1>SOVEREIGNTY AND RESPONSIBILITY</h1>

<p> At the tail of the last chapter I ask whether or not we are compelled to sin by God; the question is more broadly framed as &ldquo;how are God&rsquo;s sovereignty and our responsibility not contradictory?&rdquo; This sounds fairly academic, so let me reframe it again: &ldquo;How is it right for a divine God to send me to hell if I couldn&rsquo;t possibly have become a follower of his against his will?&rdquo; Part of the question is certainly, &ldquo;what does it mean to be guilty?&rdquo; But I think we must remember that Scripture does not only describe sin in terms of guilt &ndash; but also, if not dominantly, in terms of corruption and purity.  I don&rsquo;t want to get ahead of myself, so I&rsquo;ll first spend a bit of time establishing that God cannot do evil, and then that we are responsible for our own evil (according to Scripture). That will dovetail into the &ldquo;but how?&rdquo; portion. 1 John 1:5:  &quot;This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.&quot;</p>

<p>James 1:13: &quot;Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am being tempted by God,' for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one.&quot;</p>

<p>1 Timothy 2:3-4: &quot;This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>One, God as defined cannot do evil (if he did it he would approve of it and it would be good&#8230;) or tempt us with it (same reasoning). If we were forced to do it through his knowledge, then he would be doing evil since he made us do it. Obviously, if God is not responsible, then we are (us and the serpent). &quot;Ok, Scripture says we're responsible. But since God created us knowing we would commit evil, and we do evil, he is responsible for it regardless of if 'the Bible' says otherwise. That's a fair accusation of circular reasoning.&quot; I'm not using the above as circular reasoning to escape the argument. I'm simply giving Scripture's position on the matter as an entry point. Sartre, a philosopher, once said: &quot;beings who possess free will cannot coexist with an omnipotent and omniscient God.&quot;  This is completely correct! And consistent with what I said towards the end of the last chapter, starting with the Exodus and Ezekiel argument. We absolutely cannot. Why do you think creation is full of death, specifically death? Why do you think Hell exists? The New Testament describes the process of sanctification, begun upon being reborn by the Holy Spirit. That process, in a word, is us becoming more Christlike. What does that entail? The replacing of our will with God's will. We will either have our will replaced by God's, or go to Hell. But our will is not &quot;free.&quot; It is bent to our household. (And all the other various things I&rsquo;ve said about individual as opposed to free wills already.) Having our will replaced with his (or totally bent to his) is to our advantage. God is perfect. His decisions are perfect, his happiness and love and joy are perfect, by definition, given his nature (and that he made and will remake us to consider those things perfect as well). We could never achieve those things on our own. Thus, it is entirely to our advantage to replace our will with his (or if I am misspeaking, then say instead that our will shall be entirely bent to his), so we stop getting in our own way. And, if we reject his will, he says &quot;Okay, you don't want anything to do with me? I will abandon you to the things you have made and take all of my self away from you. That means you will have nothing good.&quot; And so we get Hell. I&rsquo;ll say it again: God's goodness is a gift, membership in his household is a gift. Truth is a gift. He certainly created us as a people with whom to share himself and these gifts, but if we reject him, we reject them. As Psalm 135 reminds us 26 times, he has made us, pursued us, fought for us, all the rest - because he is loving. Further! As Psalm 25:8 tells us, the goodness and uprightness of God, the very things we offend, are the reason he bothers to teach us what good is. 25:12 says much the same: &ldquo;Who is the man who fears the LORD? Him will he instruct in the way that he should choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Psalm 31:21 has this for us, a reminder that God is there for us while our world is on fire (perhaps literally): &ldquo;Blessed be the LORD, for he has wondrously shown his [committed] love to me when I was in a besieged city.&rdquo;   Psalm 33:18-19 echoes a similar sentiment. So God pursues us, but we have a choice in the matter. 2 Peter 1:10: &ldquo;Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He holds us responsible for that decision. Someone will ask, &quot;How is that loving? Isn't your God supposedly loving? If he loved us, he'd force us to say yes.&quot; Please, hold that thought. The rest of this chapter and the next chapter on Hell answer it. But don&rsquo;t forget that I&rsquo;ve addressed this before in part; we aren&rsquo;t owed his mercy or his gifts of goodness by virtue of us being rebels. For a Christian perspective, please read Psalm 31, specifically 9-17, verses like Psalm 35:17 (also 37:1, 9, 10&#8230; Jeremiah 12 is about this as well) which literally asks God &ldquo;How long, O Lord, will you look on?&rdquo; It also tell us that trusting questions are not in and of themselves sinful.  Here's the thing: God did not create evil, but he allowed and allows it to exist, clearly. Anyone who has chosen evil deserves Hell, and so evil inflicted to them here is no longer evil, for it cannot exceed the punishment they deserve already. It is instead mercy that we endure less than Hell. Psalm 10:1 asks, &quot;Why, O LORD, do you stand far away? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?&quot;</p>

<p>Psalm 10 then talks of evildoers who declare there to be no God and no justice, who prey on the weak and powerless. It calls for God to &quot;break the arm of the wicked and evildoer&quot;. It says God reigns, he hears the pain of the afflicted, he strengthens their heart and lends him their ear to &quot;do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed, so that man who is of the earth may strike terror no more.&quot; Psalm 41:3, in a more literal rendering, says:  &ldquo;Yahweh will support him on his sickbed; all his bed you rearrange in his sickness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why do I bother to say all that? Because I cannot resist the need to demonstrate God&rsquo;s love in this, to argue against the accusation that he is not loving, and that a lack of love does not prompt our being given responsibility. I am repeating information from the &ldquo;why did he make us&rdquo; part of the book, though, so let&rsquo;s move on. &quot;Why didn't he prevent the evildoer from doing the evil? Why does he deliver justice after the fact? Why does he let me be sick instead of supporting me on my sickbed and changing my sheets or whatever?&quot; For one, he gives us all the same chance to repent. Two, if he punished somebody before they'd done something evil, even if he knows they'll do it, none of us would exist. Where exactly would you like that line? &quot;Just prevent the most heinous acts done to the most vulnerable.&quot; Why does the line fall there? Define heinous. Define vulnerable. Can you tell me? No, you can't come up with an objective reason for why the line should be there. What these questions reveal is a clamor for justice and care deep in our hearts. Who put that there do you wonder? I don't intend to argue along that line, except to say this: he does prevent evil. Don't mistake me, he roots it out and destroys it. Christ was kinda here to do away with evil, to defeat it, no? He will end all sickness and discomfort and pain. Psalm 5 says the following: &quot;&#8230;Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my groaning. Give attention to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to you do I pray. &#8230; For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil may not dwell with you. The boastful shall not stand before your eyes; you hate all evildoers. You destroy those who speak lies; the LORD abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. &#8230; For there is no truth in their mouth; their inmost self is destruction; their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongue. Make them bear their guilt, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; because of the abundance of their transgressions cast them out, for they have rebelled against you. But let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them ever sing for joy, and spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may exult in you. For you bless the righteous, O LORD; you cover him with favor as with a shield.&quot;</p>

<p>Remember, this chapter is not just about responsibility, but also sovereignty. God deals with evil and pain on his schedule, not ours. We can be harmed, abused, wronged, but he is the only one that can be sinned against.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve said &ldquo;no one is innocent but Christ&rdquo; a few times. So let&rsquo;s look at those we generally consider innocent, children and infants, and a few specific Old Testament examples. Really, I shouldn&rsquo;t be using the terms innocent and guilty here &ndash; Scripture uses the terms corrupted and pure. But when I say innocent, I mean in the specific matter at hand. It makes no sense for an infant to be legally guilty of something, but it is entirely possible for a baby to be corrupted.  First up is after David has sex with Bathsheba and subsequently murdered her husband (had him murdered, . His crime was ultimately against God, though, not Uriah, for God sets morality and God has authority: Uriah was harmed, of course, but whose law was transgressed by this act? David, in Psalm 51:4, says this: &quot;Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words and blameless in your judgement.&quot;</p>

<p> After David sinned, one of the consequences of David's sin was that the child born to David by Bathsheba would die: &quot;However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, the child also who is born to you shall surely die &#8230; And the Lord struck the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and it became very ill &#8230; Then on the seventh day it came to pass that the child died&quot;     There's no wriggling out of this: God killed the child. This perhaps seems shocking or unique on the face of it, but we know God killed children in the flood of Noah. When Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed, there were doubtlessly children and infants there as well. I have heard it argued that &quot;Oh well, God didn't actually kill the child; in 1 Chronicles 10:13-14 it says God put Saul to death, when we know from 1 Samuel that Saul killed himself.&quot; But the difference is that yes, often things God permits are established as things God did in the Old Testament; but not in this case. In this case we are told, specifically, literally, that God struck the child and it got sick and died.  David's child was conceived in sin, and born as a consequence of sin. Much like God used the murder and torture of his own son to handle sin, God used the sickness and death of David's child to handle David's sin, although in a disciplinary as opposed to the redemptive manner of Christ. Does that make sense? God used the sickness and death of the child for good, for his justice. I would argue you can never verify that the death of a supposed innocent (or one certainly innocent in a specific matter) was used for no greater purpose. Since the death of the child was used for good, I would dismiss the charge of it being evil on those grounds. But opponents have responded with some variation of the following a few times: 1. The death of an innocent is always morally evil regardless of any good it causes. 2. A perfectly good God would not kill innocent children. 3. The Christian God kills innocent children. 4. The Christian God cannot be perfectly good.</p>

<p>The logical error is this: these postulates assume that the death of an innocent child is, without exception, evil. Of course, we can discuss whether they are truly innocent in the first place, which I will do later on. (Innocent and guilty aren&rsquo;t really the right words in the context of infants and such, the better words would be &ldquo;corrupted&rdquo; or &ldquo;pure&rdquo;.) Matthew 16:26 says this: &quot;For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?&quot;</p>

<p>James 4:14: &quot;What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes.&quot;</p>

<p>In Matthew, Christ is relating the relative value of your immortal soul to anything physical; in James, we see another comparison of the absolute value of our physical lives here on earth. To us, our lives are a big deal; they are, after all, the only one we've got, and the only one we know. But God sees our bodies, when put in perspective with our soul, as not much more than clothes we've put on, possessions. 1 Corinthians 6:12-20 tells us the body still has value, and where that value comes from: being a temple for the indwelling Holy Spirit, that was bought by the death and resurrection of Christ. If the redeemed person's body was &quot;purchased&quot; in this manner and is God's, and its value is how it serves God, then according to Scripture, our bodies in and of themselves are not worth much in perspective. I say that to clarify, the human loss when someone, anyone dies, especially an infant or child, is severe. There is a graveyard near my house I frequently walk in, and there's a small headstone for a baby who only lived for five days. Every Easter, there is a basket with a small lamb toy and eggs in it on that grave. The grave is over forty-five years old.  Even Christ cried when Lazarus died. I have my own experiences of death, and so do those close to me, so don't mistake what I'm saying. I am not saying death isn't a painful experience for those left behind, or painful at the time for those who die themselves. Death remains a divine curse upon creation, the chief weapon of Goliath. But see below Paul in Philippians 1 describing his view on death. I should note, Paul did not die happily, and knew he wouldn't. He was executed after his trial in Rome, and long endured prison and suffering: &quot;&#8230;now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.&quot;     The proper attitude to death is additionally found in Psalm 39 and 2nd Corinthians 15-17 &ndash; don&rsquo;t make light of it, and do not make it out as worse for the Christian than it is. For the redeemed, to die is to leave the fallen world and go and be with Christ. For the unredeemed, to die is to end the time of mercy and go to judgement (more on Hell in the next chapter), so claiming that death is always morally evil is yet more unfounded, regardless of whether one is innocent or not. On the one hand, it is a certain upgrade. On the other, it is the end of unearned mercy and patience. Isaiah 57 offers some closing thoughts on the matter of death:  &quot;The righteous man perishes, and no one lays it to heart; devout men are taken away, while no one understands. For the righteous man is taken away from calamity; he enters into peace; they rest in their beds who walk in their uprightness.&quot;</p>

<p> Isaiah is telling us people will misinterpret the death of the righteous, that they go to peace, away from calamity and evil, to God's peace and rest. But he does not stop there:  &quot;But you, draw near, sons of the sorceress, offspring of the adulterer and the loose woman. &#8230; Are you not children of transgression, the offspring of deceit &#8230; Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion; they, they, are your lot; &#8230; Have I not held my peace, even for a long time, and you do not fear me? I will declare your righteousness and your deeds, but they will not profit you. When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you! The wind will carry them all off, a breath will take them away. &#8230;&quot;</p>

<p> There's a lot there that I won't unpack, but you can get the gist of what's being said I trust, it's fairly blunt. There are two options: for those going to Hell, death isn't morally problematic, and for those not, death still isn't morally problematic. (Excluding that death only exists because of the Fall. I mean in terms of God&rsquo;s rightness to inflict us with such.) The death of the innocent is thus gain for them; they go straight to God's peace and joy. Again, do not mistake my point. I am not saying Christians should kill themselves to go be with God. Christians are called to do work here in this fallen world, and that is the very point Paul made. We have things we need to do for God's kingdom, and since we have been purchased, our time to die is not rightfully in our hands. I am tired of hearing fools claim Christians should want to kill themselves. There is a tension we must hold in place that death is a divine curse upon creation, that it causes immense suffering and is often painful. Yet for the Christian, it is a joyous going.   Here is Christ discussing this very topic in John 21 with Peter, concerning how Peter was going to die violently and John was to die of old age: &quot;&#8230;Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.' (This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, 'Follow me.'  Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, &#8230; When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, 'Lord, what about this man?' Jesus said to him, 'If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!'&quot;</p>

<p> Christ makes the point fairly clear here, I think, that it's got nothing to do with us, that God is sovereign over our fates, and uses them as he will for his maximal glory. Furthermore, in Luke 13, Jesus commented on two recent events: one was the slaughter of a group who had gone to the temple by Pilate. Another was the fall of a tower that killed eighteen people. Christ, then, rejected the notion that suffering on Earth is proportional to sinfulness, and that tragedy is a certain sign of special or particular judgement. From John 9:  &quot;As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth. And his disciples asked him, 'Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?' Jesus answered, 'It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him.'&quot;</p>

<p> Christ, of course, then proceeded to fix his eyesight, so the story goes in Scripture. This, like the death of David's child, is an example of an affliction being used for God's good, of death and suffering being for his glory. (I would not go so far as to turn those verses into a maxim, that they're all the evidence or justification needed to say all suffering is for God's glory.) I suppose stating that suffering being non-proportional to sinfulness could seem like injustice to some, but creation is the land of mercy. If mercy is a gift, it's no injustice for it to be bestowed unequally among recipients.  [][][][][]He recognizes our plight and hates evildoers, and deals with them as he sees fit. We are asked to trust him and seek his deliverance, to praise and respect his sovereignty. He will mete out justice if and when forgiveness is rejected (and repentance not undertaken). Exodus 4:11: &quot;Then the LORD said to him, 'Who has made man's mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the LORD?&quot;</p>

<p> Psalm 105:15 (concerning the Egyptians):  &quot;He called down famine on the land and destroyed all their supplies of food;&quot;</p>

<p> 2nd Kings 17:25:  &quot; And at the beginning of their dwelling there, they did not fear the LORD. Therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which killed some of them.&quot;</p>

<p>The Christian God has mechanisms in place to handle evil. He offers two ways to get rid of it: his justice, or his mercy. Like a broken record I&rsquo;ll hear &ldquo;he should handle evil sooner,&quot; and we&rsquo;re right back to &ldquo;whose schedule matters more&rdquo;? Really, the more you probe this, the more you run into matters of opinion. It&rsquo;s a binary, though: either evil invalidates God or it doesn&rsquo;t; there is no threshold of evil that can be defended. And the answer I have laid out is that it does not (wait a page or so and I&rsquo;ll tackle this more thoroughly). Nobody pure and innocent suffers from evil, except God who willingly subjected himself to it while here as a man. We can disagree and express different preferences, but the way he's done it is consistent and reasonable by his definitions and goals.  &quot;How many people want a choice to do evil or not? How many people would rather just be slaves and there be no suffering? I'd rather everyone be a righteous slave by design than have this world.&quot; The reply is quick and easy: clearly not, because every day you choose to sin. By our every sin, we affirm the way God has chosen to set things up. The difference between a Christian and someone who rejects God is not whether or not they approve of us being allowed to do evil: we've all said that we like being able to do evil. So say that all you want, but your actions prove otherwise.  Another rebuttal I get is this, and it more about the MSSOF: &quot;I want you to say everything you just said while standing at Auschwitz, at the showers with nail marks in metal, and tell me it doesn't sound cheap.&quot; One reader had a rather forceful version of this objection: &quot;Your god allows child rapists. He watches children get raped, and says 'I'm going to punish you for that eventually.' Any sane person would stop the rape of a child they saw occurring. Your god isn't worthy of my love, whether or not it 'invalidates' him from a logical standpoint.&quot; Psalm 13 expresses this question in a non-sinful manner, verses 1-4: &ldquo;How long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? How long must I take counsel in my soul and have sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me? Consider and answer me, O LORD my God; light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death, lest my enemy say, 'I have prevailed over him,' lest my foes rejoice because I am shaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Psalm 22 is an even more emotional account of the same. We've been over this by this point, but this is a sobering topic, and the way I&rsquo;ve presented it is not how many of us are used to thinking about this problem. Actually, it's probably not sobering, even! I've possibly upset you. Who, upon hearing, &quot;the worst day of your life was still better than you deserve,&quot; is going to go, &quot;gee thanks, let me think about that you might be right&quot;?  Truth is truth even amidst horror (perhaps especially so), so the answer is the same: upon what grounds does anybody demand more mercy from him for the human race? They want him to stop evil right now, but when I say, &quot;Ok, before you finish blinking you'll be in hell,&quot; out comes the &quot;wait wait wait not my evil that evil,&quot; followed up by explanations that &quot;obviously we're talking about the real evil that's out there,&quot; so it's always some other evil we deem too bad to be allowed, never our own. &quot;I'm not as bad as that guy,&quot; they say. Certainly, they are not as bad as the literal worst of humanity. The thing is, in the end, God will make it right. God is a person of ends and eternities. He came down here and went through the thick of it too. He got beaten, mocked, whipped, stabbed by nails, betrayed, and hung on a cross. It's not like he's far away from our pain: he's intimately familiar with it. Scripture is very much solid on the idea that what matters is something&rsquo;s eternal end. Transitory states are exactly that, and they will end. God is not ignorant of our plight during such states, however, hence his coming down to rescue his people from Egypt and all the rest. None of his covenants promise us no suffering here on Earth, or among the stars, should we cooperate well enough for long enough to get there. I see in these shock value attacks that usually they're trying to blame God as if he bears the guilt of something he didn't do. He is assuredly sovereign over it, but there's a difference. Many Psalms give us an image of someone broken, wishing for death, grabbing God with one hand and limply hitting his thigh with the other, begging to know why or when it will end. These questions boil down to something very simple yet profound: has God betrayed us by letting such things happen? Never mind theological this and that's about contradictions. Has God betrayed us? God set us on this path and sovereignly dictates that it continue. Psalm 12:5: &ldquo;'Because the poor are plundered, because the needy groan, I will now arise,' says the LORD; 'I will place him in the safety for which he longs.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes I have people tell me the world doesn't need another book like mine. We need &quot;practical application&quot; not &quot;theological treatises defending God's existence.&quot; Well, buddy, I'm not doing that. I'm asking and answering questions that have profound impacts on how we relate to God. Doesn't get any more practical than that.  The effects of sin are uncomfortable, the fallen aspects of our world are insufferable, depressing, sorrowful&#8230; because that is what they are. I cannot help but see some sad irony in attempts to use the worst of the fallen world in an attempt to paint God as the bad guy, when the fallen world is the very antithesis of God himself: death and evil. It's as if one pointed to the desert and said &quot;You see? Water is disgusting! Look what happens when it is absent.&quot; You would rightly scratch your head.  God can&rsquo;t do evil, man is (as of yet, somehow) responsible for sin. Aligning ourselves with God is good. He owes us no mercy, and since we&rsquo;re not in Hell, we&rsquo;re all the recipients of abundant mercy and patience already. Importantly, he listens to our pain and takes action on his schedule and in his way. Sin&rsquo;s effects are terrible, but they will go away. God is sovereign over evil, sovereign over us.  I mentioned it briefly, but is all evil necessary? Could there be some unnecessary evil? I&rsquo;ve gone into that there is necessary evil at length; but this is a different form of the discussion. So let&rsquo;s walk through whether there is unnecessary evil, and then I will argue that God only uses evil for good, he does not cause evil for good.  The reality here boils down to this: God must get more glory from a world with evil than one without evil. Since glory is his goal, it must somehow be enhanced by there being evil. My argument in prior chapters was this: God valued us worshiping him not out of obligation, but through trial the &ldquo;proven genuineness &rdquo; of our faith, more highly than us never having committed evil in the first place. But here's the conundrum: God doesn't need anything. He's complete. He's just sharing his glory with us through this, right? Let's let the opponent word it this way: &quot;Is evil necessary for God's glory to be maximized (his stated goal in Scripture)? If the answer is no, why does evil exist? Wouldn't that mean the universe is not maximally good since a system could exist where there was no evil? Put another way, if God doesn't need evil to maximize his goals, why does it exist?&rdquo;  There's two ways to look at this. If we rush through the thinking, we may arrive at something like this: if the answer is no (to the first question), then there cannot be a God since he would never tolerate evil in his system, unless it was absolutely necessary for there to be evil for him to maximally accomplish his goals. I'm going to use this phrasing of the challenge about unnecessary evil to demonstrate why we have to be careful about answering questions that are too non-specific. Because when phrased the way it has been above, the rebuttal's answer is rather obviously &quot;No, God does not need evil to accomplish his goals.&quot; But I've already established that for the specific God of Scripture, who is a communal being whose goal is his glory being maximized, he desired to create creatures to share in it with him. Those creatures will necessarily commit evil acts (again, as argued some pages hence). So the answer becomes &quot;Yes, there is necessary evil with regards to wanting a people for himself.&quot; Since I have established that God's chosen goal with creation necessitates making beings that necessarily commit evil, the answer has become yes. This means that the evil that exists is necessary and it is not a God-invalidating problem. If there was evil outside of a creation that necessitated it, then we would have a problem.  Let me restate that: God decided that having a people to share himself with maximized his glory ; but any people that could be conceived of or wrought would necessarily create evil. This means there is necessary evil. I am not saying that the Christian God needs evil; he wants a people to glorify himself with (for their good and because of his love and light &ndash; he wants to share), and that necessitates handling evil. God&rsquo;s definition of perfect goodness involves perfect justice and outcome for evil &ndash; that all things be set right that evil set wrong. For this means all things are &lsquo;right&rsquo; and thus &lsquo;good&rsquo;.) It is clear that God&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;maximal good&rdquo; does not include &ldquo;no transient evil.&rdquo; It includes &ldquo;no eternal evil,&rdquo; that is for sure.  Anyway, I could very easily just say: If the coexistence of God and evil is valid under the previously described argument, then the specifics of the evil are, while not irrelevant, immaterial. But I don&rsquo;t find that satisfying, so it is time to discuss God bringing good from the evil that is, rather than doing evil to produce good. Scripture! First is Romans 3:3-8: &quot;&#8230; Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God? By no means! Let God be true though every one were a liar, as it is written, 'That you may be justified in your words, and prevail when you are judged.' But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.) By no means! For then how could God judge the world? But if through my lie God's truth abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner? And why not do evil that good may come?&mdash;as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just.&quot;</p>

<p>That quote from Psalm 51:4 (quoted by Paul within the Romans quote) really serves to make the argument: our faithlessness and unholiness only exemplify God&rsquo;s holiness and faithfulness. Even when we rebel/sin/create evil, we give God more glory by amplifying his justice and his devotion to redeeming his chosen remnant. However, we should be careful about making the same argument Paul denies in that quote. Paul explains that part in Galatians 2:17-18:  &quot;But if, in seeking to be justified in Christ, we Jews find ourselves also among the sinners, doesn&rsquo;t that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not! If I rebuild what I destroyed, then I really would be a lawbreaker.&quot;</p>

<p>If the body is a temple for God, and when we sin we tear down that temple&#8230; then sure, God's grace is it's abounding more, but it's just being spent rebuilding what your sin destroyed. It's not increasing the temple past where it was, it's just restoring it. There's a second way I interpret it, that's more like &quot;if I tear the temple down, but then rebuild it, I've admitted I did something wrong. Which means I knew what I did the first time was wrong all along.&quot; So he's bluntly saying, &quot;you're being an idiot by trying to defeat the idea that sin is bad by admitting sin is bad.&quot; Past that, and back to the Romans quote, one thing I can clearly see is that he's saying, &quot;If God benefits from judging our sin, that doesn't mean he is wrong to judge it.&quot; These are the caveats surrounding the idea that God can use evil for good &ndash; we cannot do that. God can use our evil, but if we create evil in some twisted way to make good, we&rsquo;re making unnecessary evil and that is not how this works. Scripture is here drawing a clear line between necessary and unnecessary evil, especially unnecessary evil we engage in when we know better than to do so.</p>

<p>The answer to this necessarily comes from responsibility for sin. Here's a long section from Jeremiah 18 (paragraph breaks added for clarity): &quot;The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: 'Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will let you hear my words.' So I went down to the potter's house, and there he was working at his wheel.  And the vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter's hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to do. Then the word of the LORD came to me: 'O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter has done? declares the LORD. Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.  If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it, and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will relent of the disaster that I intended to do to it.  And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it, and if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will relent of the good that I had intended to do to it.  Now, therefore, say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: 'Thus says the LORD, Behold, I am shaping disaster against you and devising a plan against you. Return, every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your deeds.' 'But they say, 'That is in vain! We will follow our own plans, and will every one act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.'  'Therefore thus says the LORD: Ask among the nations, Who has heard the like of this? The virgin Israel has done a very horrible thing. &#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>This section if Scripture is incredibly powerful, and I pray I wield it well. The first conclusions from it: 1. Human actions of repentance, faithfulness, rebellion, and evil have significance. Any can turn from their evil and escape judgement by having faith in the Lord. Any can turn from the good God intends for us too, though! 2. God advises us on what is best, and humans have two reactions to God telling us: &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; and &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Romans 9:16-24 also contains a pottery section (13-16 contain some verses concerning God having the right to be merciful to who he wishes): &quot;For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, 'For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.' So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills. You will say to me then, 'Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?' But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, 'Why have you made me like this?' Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use?  What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory&mdash;even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles?&quot;</p>

<p>Phew. Ezekiel 33:11 must remain fresh in our minds; God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked. This prompts a query of sweeping importance, one that the pureblood Calvinist says is &ldquo;irreconcilable.&rdquo; (I hear many say this.) But I challenge them so: anything which is truly irreconcilable is a contradiction, and that cannot be. They claim to know where God has drawn the line on what is knowable, and that cannot be. Did they design God&rsquo;s words on his tongue?  The true and deep interpretation of these has been shielded from my eyes for years. Perhaps it still is, but my best understanding, hopefully God-given, is as follows. First I want to make a point about the &lsquo;book of life.&rsquo; See Revelation 17:8 first: &ldquo;&#8230;And the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world &#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Psalm 69:28: &quot;May they be blotted out of the book of life and not be listed with the righteous.&quot;</p>

<p>Revelation 13:8: &quot;All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast&mdash;all whose names have not been written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world.&quot;</p>

<p>Revelation 20:15: &quot;Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.&quot;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s something to this &ndash; that it appears one can be blotted out of the book, or never written in the book in the first place. I would argue &lsquo;not being found&rsquo; is the ultimate sense of this; what does it mean, though, that to not be found in the book can be achieved either through not being written, or being blotted out? It cannot be that when someone is saved their name is written and then blotted out if they fail; this blasphemously contradicts Christ&rsquo;s clear promises. I think we find ourselves torturing an obvious analogy, really. If Scripture saying &ldquo;Hey man Elijah&rsquo;s gonna come back,&rdquo; (Malachi 4:5-6) can end up in rebukes for thinking it literally meant Elijah would return (Matthew 17:10-13), then it is probably the case we can be rebuked for trying to take the idea of a book of life too literally. (If you and I see one another at the throne and a literal book gets pulled out, be sure to point at me and I&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;whoopsie.&rdquo;)  But what would &lsquo;blotting out&rsquo; and &lsquo;not being written&rsquo; refer to, in literal terms? Probably the concepts of a final moment of no return (attested to scripturally), and God&rsquo;s sovereign election of man from the beginning. The former marks the moment one finally accedes to the fate God knew they would take from the beginning.  Here&rsquo;s a nagging thought, though, expressed by our generic detractor: &ldquo;Would God condemn billions from time immemorial to display his goodness to a few? The thought is a bit repugnant, no? Why not just make the ones he intended to redeem and redeem them? We're all responsible for our sins, and God does not owe us anything, including mercy; but he still purposed them to not get saved and to go to Hell. Did he do so just to have someone to put in Hell? Why not only create the people he intended to redeem? Again, I know it's our fault we're going - Romans 1:20 says as much. But it cannot be denied he intended for billions of us to wind up in Hell. It's not so much a value judgement of &lsquo;is God getting glory by torturing people in Hell worth the subjective torment of those in Hell,&rsquo; (however deserved), because if God says it's worth it, it is. But I more mean, &lsquo;is that why he made people who were destined to go to Hell? To show his justice and wrath?&rsquo;&rdquo; First Ezekiel 33:11, as referenced: &quot;Say to them, As I live, declares the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn back, turn back from your evil ways, for why will you die, O house of Israel?&quot;</p>

<p>Another is 2 Peter 3:9-10: &ldquo;The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance. But the day of the Lord will come like a thief&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I fully intend to argue that Hell is a good thing for the remnant and God in the next chapter. The focus here is not on Hell as a thing, but on God purposing that billions would go there, however much they deserve it. It&rsquo;s entirely likely that when we&rsquo;re in heaven and we see God, we will buckle with understanding the sheer injustice it is to sin against him. (We should do this now, but I suspect we can&rsquo;t fully appreciate it in our current state.)  But this still is not the point of that nagging thought. Obviously, Hell exists to punish injustice. But why make it and why allow the beings who will cause the injustice? Why not have an empty Hell?  Do you see how those questions are a reframing of &ldquo;does there exist unnecessary evil?&rdquo; We would like to think that anybody who winds up in Hell has done an unnecessary evil, that it was avoidable. Was it?</p>

<p>The opponent says: &quot;If God knew we would sin, as you say, and if any conceivable being would sin, he essentially created evil by creating them. Further, if God were really omnipotent and omniscient, there would be no free will so he would be responsible for our actions, and evil is his responsibility.&quot;  That warrants a bit of elaboration, if you&rsquo;re not familiar with this argument. It follows like so: God is omniscient. Everything is therefore knowledge for him. Knowledge is immutable and previously set as true. This means everything about us and everything we&rsquo;ll do is set in stone. A lot of people try to dismiss this by talking about &ldquo;middle knowledge&rdquo; and so much nonsense; at one point even I used random number generators (don&rsquo;t ask) and such and such to try and get around this. But everybody who does this, the one making the argument and the one defending against it, makes the same logical error. They all assume that for us to have independent wills God would have to be neither omnipotent nor omniscient. There is no reason that's the case, no contradiction can be proved. I won&rsquo;t argue it by way of analogy; too many times people torture analogies made here. There is no analogy that works. But I&rsquo;ll say it another way: an omniscient and omnipotent God could easily grant us from his power independent wills. Other scholars call this God&rsquo;s &ldquo;permissive will,&rdquo; but I don&rsquo;t like that terminology. God has one will. Walk with me through something a bit out there. Look at humans as clay, clay that can be formed into pottery. Now imagine all clay is red &ndash; it is just red. To say &ldquo;clay&rdquo; is to invite &ldquo;red.&rdquo; Redness is, of course, the capacity for disobedience. So when God made clay, he made creatures with the capacity for disobedience. Blue clay, let&rsquo;s say, is clay with no capacity for disobedience.  Romans 9:13-24, feels like a sadist going &quot;I'm choosing not to punish you, but look how I punish these other people in my prison and know my mercy,&quot; If that were correct, the reply would be, &quot;Well, mate, you made the prison and made everyone who would go there, it&rsquo;s your fault!&quot; But that's not correct. Let&rsquo;s use the same clay analogy as a moment before. By default and necessarily, humans are red clay. God chooses some red clay to turn blue. Red clay he sends to Hell. How is it the red clay's fault that it's red? It just is red. It can't willingly make itself blue. Part of being red may even be wanting to be red, but that's still just redness that it came with by default, right? The core issue here is he inflicts suffering on the red clay for its redness. It seems he's decreed that, even though wanting to be red is part of redness, and there's no way to escape redness on your own and you are necessarily red to begin with, you're still at fault for redness and should suffer for all eternity.  Here, let me push this further: He has also foreordained which red lumps of clay will become blue, so it's not like the red lumps even get a fair shot at becoming blue (indeed, 2nd Corinthians 4:4 tells us the 'god of this age' also prevents red clay from seeing light at all, so red clay is doubly screwed). It says he already knows who will become blue, so those who are doomed to be red have no choice in the matter. Said with better theological precision, they were &quot;made for dishonorable use&quot; such that they would inevitably choose to reject the offer to become blue. But wait, doesn't this disagree with Scripture? Ezekiel 33:1-6 clearly establishes our responsibility, among any other number of verses. Isaiah 45:18-19: &quot;&#8230;'I am the LORD, and there is no other. I did not speak in secret, in a land of darkness; I did not say to the offspring of Jacob, 'Seek me in vain.' I the LORD speak the truth; I declare what is right.&quot;</p>

<p>Psalm 9:15-16: &quot;The nations have sunk in the pit that they made; in the net that they hid, their own foot has been caught. The LORD has made himself known; he has executed judgment; the wicked are snared in the work of their own hands.&quot;  This all is rather confusing but sure sounds like it&rsquo;s making a compelling case that we aren&rsquo;t responsible for our sin. Yet, one cannot escape that God holds us responsible for our actions. But how?  Well, a bit anti-climactically, he&rsquo;s sort of being saying it pretty plainly this whole time. He knew us all before we were born, and incorporated who we are into his plan. He put everyone exactly where and when he needed them to accomplish his purposes optimally. When I wrote this section, I had not yet finished studying Jeremiah, so I was delighted to find the following in Jeremiah 10:23-24: &quot;I know, O LORD, that the way of man is not in himself, that it is not in man who walks to direct his steps. Correct me, O LORD, but in justice; not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>Consider also Psalm 33:12-15: &quot;Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people whom he has chosen [to be an inheritance for himself]! The LORD looks down from heaven; he sees all the children of man; from where he sits enthroned he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth, [he who altogether shapes their heart, he who discerns all their works.]&quot;</p>

<p>God knows what every possible person's choices would be when presented with whatever situations, and he saw fit to use them. Earlier in Isaiah 45 God describes using Cyrus as his tool, and I've mentioned before that God wields history as a tool, and describes himself as a rider on a horse, steering it where to go. Isaiah 10:5-11 lays this out pretty explicitly: &quot;Woe to Assyria, the rod of my anger; the staff in their hands is my fury! Against a godless nation I send him, and against the people of my wrath I command him, to take spoil and seize plunder, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. But he does not so intend, and his heart does not so think; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few; for he says: 'Are not my commanders all kings? &#8230; shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols as I have done to Samaria and her images?'&quot;</p>

<p> I think I said something pretty important too quickly there. My argument is this: the way you reconcile our responsibility with God's sovereignty and foreknowledge is that God knows us, thoroughly. He knows everybody thoroughly. And, in his wisdom, he put every person he saw fit to make exist where they needed to be so that they would accomplish his purposes. He sovereignly lets our sin unfold, he allows us to sin as we wish, and intervenes when he needs to to bring about his purposes. God&rsquo;s argument is that he has all this clay, and he refines some of it, and leaves some of it as-is. The some he leaves, receives some mercy and nice things here (relative to what it deserves), before it gets what it deserves. While it is here, he also uses it to further his goals. So the red clay is used optimally, and then because it was allowed to choose as it wanted to choose&#8230; (sit with that for a second), it then receives the fate it deserved through that choosing. Isaiah 57, quoted earlier, speaks to this (around verse 6), but so does Psalm 17:13-15: &ldquo;Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword, from men by your hand, O LORD, from men of the world whose portion is in this life. You fill their womb with treasure; they are satisfied with children, and they leave their abundance to their infants. As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness; when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Making red clay is not problematic, since that&rsquo;s the only type of clay you can start with. Red clay suffering for its redness is justified, since it involves a decision to remain as you are in the face of what Romans 1:20 calls having no excuse to do so. Scripture is fairly clear on this, we have no excuse, yet we do so anyway because it&rsquo;s what we are. Even if you tell him he is red, tell him the fate of being red, and tell him about being blue and the fate of being blue and the benefits of being blue&#8230; he will just try to take as many of those benefits without becoming blue as he can, without changing from red. The remaining argument here is not a repetition of &quot;God should make them all blue!&quot; I've argued that nobody has a claim to God's mercy. Clearly, it is also not that redness (the capacity for disobedience) is in and of itself bad; God called all creation, including us, &quot;very good&quot; in Genesis 1:31 before we had sinned. The actual remaining problem is this: why is red clay destined for eternal suffering instead of non-existence? Why did it exist at all? What is God getting out of putting red clay in eternal torment that is worth their eternal torment? This is the absolutely critical question! Frankly, he gets justice. The correct punishment for rebellion against the maximal good is the maximal bad, yes? If we don&rsquo;t have any excuse for continuing in our sin, if he gave us everything necessary to not sin (recall the vineyard verses from Isaiah), if he is merciful to us despite our insistence on sinning, if he chases after us despite our perpetual running away (the book of Numbers is a story of God finding a way to bring his holiness close to his people), if he rescues us despite our hating of it, do we have a leg to stand on when he finally says &ldquo;off you go to my justice&rdquo; that he doesn&rsquo;t have a right to do it? For the fifteenth time, we cannot declare that he must force us to abandon our sin &ndash; by now I hope you see how cheap that sounds beyond the reasons given. [][][][][][][] In my hours of staring at this question, I returned to that best book for God sovereignly decreeing men must suffer, Job (who by the way was not sinless and so there&rsquo;s no real &ldquo;he suffered unjustly&rdquo; claim to be made), and we find the same responses in there.  1. He asks us to trust him.  2. He informs us that we can't possibly understand what's going on or fully grasp these things, so for us to say &quot;that's not right,&quot; is prideful ignorance.  3. As originator and owner of all things, he has a right to do with all things what he wills, not what those things will.  &quot;Is that all, Author? Wow that's&#8230; no different than what you've been saying.&rdquo; I tend to agree a bit, so, I looked at his response in Job for a while before I realized something (or God pointed me at it more likely, if it proves correct). He says &quot;there's a system here that works, I made it, I run it, I thought of every single detail, from the high cosmos even down to where and when deer give birth; trust me.&quot; And I think that&rsquo;s as far as he&rsquo;s going to let us get. But two very important things: 1. We are all individually part of that system. It&rsquo;s all well and good that we approach this issue in such a general way, talking about some abstract clay man, but it&rsquo;s you and God at the end of the day, and broadly the people you love and care about. But specifically it&rsquo;s you and God. No individual human knows where God has assigned them, and so from the individual&rsquo;s perspective, they receive the information and decide what to do with it. Scripture does not approach this issue from the viewpoint of abstract man. It always approaches it from the specific individual. That is certainly purposeful.  2. If the answer is simply this: God allows them to continue in their evil to serve his purpose of displaying his wrath, that is troubling if and only if you look at it from the abstract clay man. Once you zoom in on a specific person, as God does in Job, you find an evil creature that enjoys its evil and chooses it and loves doing it.  It seems to me we&rsquo;re running into the same issue as usual here. I&rsquo;ve given you some different perspectives on it, but as far as I can tell, I have argued this to the point of &ldquo;value judgement.&rdquo; Us not liking something is certainly reason enough to not follow him, to our detriment, but it is not enough to discard him as impossible, as it is not a contradiction.</p>

<p> What follows is a conversation I had about the above that serves as something of a summary of it. It is not fully fleshed out, of course, but it may remind you of some key points I made. If you are not interested in a practical application of what I argued above, you may simply follow the question to the next chapter. It is lightly edited for grammar and clarity. [About a woman suffering in the hospital.] &quot;These are moments when you wonder where God is and why people have to endure this.&quot; First, I hear you; I really do. We see suffering and pain and we can't help but recognize the wrongness of it. But we can't blame God when Goliath is right there. So let's think about this theologically. Why would God owe the lady anything? He doesn&rsquo;t owe her peace or a lack of pain. How could she make a claim on him for such? Yet, God promised to remove such evil from the world on his schedule, not ours. (For some people that&rsquo;s quite soon, for others not at all in this life.) Again I say, do we have a right to demand he do it on our schedule instead of his? Especially when two things are true: 1. We&rsquo;re all sinful rebels who deserve immediate annihilation, meaning anything less than Hell is already merciful. 2. He knows far better than we do how the world works and what&rsquo;s best. Too often I see people stare at evil like the Israelites stared at Goliath with nothing but fear, and abandon faith. &quot;So even infants are sinners? The Bible says that God knows each human being before they are born so he knows who will murder and rape. which babies will die from cancer, Hitler will be born yet no divine intervention because we have 'free choice'. If humans know for sure intent to kill or injure another, they can be charged for failure to act.&quot; Nobody can demand God stop Hitler; on what grounds could they? &quot;God isn&rsquo;t as merciful as I like, he doesn&rsquo;t give me what I want or do what I think is best,&quot; is not a good argument. What actual grounds do you have that he should act on your preferred schedule and against your preferred targets? Mind that if you want God to intervene against evil, you yourself should be in hell before you finish blinking. &quot;No not me, that other evil.&quot; Right. Not one of Hitler&rsquo;s victims was innocent before God. (By the way, he was stopped - his regime crumbled into ash. But not fast enough, right?) The only person who ever got anything worse than he deserved was Jesus Christ. The rest of us get more than we deserve day in day out as God is patient with us; if we should be burning alive in hell, anything we experience here is better than that, and is merciful in comparison to where we belong. We should thus be happy that we get any mercy whatsoever, for it is far more than we deserve to be on this earth for one microsecond past our first sin. To your first point, why would an &lsquo;innocent&rsquo; person have any more claim to God&rsquo;s mercy than anyone else? God doesn&rsquo;t owe any human being anything. God knows our pain and does not like it. He will end it. But on his schedule and in his way, not ours. And we have no right and no grounds to insist anything different.</p>

<p>&quot;My feelings are not swayed. God chooses not to intervene and gives no reason why. I would hope my fellow human being would intervene if I needed it. God has the power but chooses not to. The Bible says God does not give burdens we cannot bare yet thousands kill themselves because the burden is too great. No too many suffer and God does nothing.&quot;</p>

<p> A few points there. In Job, God explains to us that we don&rsquo;t understand, and he is in control of the system; by asking Job what the reasoning is for cosmic and even local phenomena, he implicitly tells us there is a reason. But he wants us to trust him. (Sort of the whole point of faith, and the reason for the trees in the garden, but that&rsquo;s too in the weeds.)  Second, as I said, we have no right to demand mercy from God. However, we find here a value judgement: you say a God who intervenes every time, indeed one who prevented all evil ever, is morally superior to the Christian God, who did not. But is that truly the case? Can you prove the total prevention of suffering is the ultimate moral good? I would argue it cannot be: any moral good which is predicated upon the existence of a moral ill cannot be the ultimate standard, because the ultimate standard of morality must transcend the mere absence of moral ills and encompass its own being - especially given the inherently fluid and subjective nature of suffering. (God tells us the actual standard in Scripture: his own character.) Third, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what verse you&rsquo;re quoting; the only one I know refers to him not allowing you to be tempted more than you can bear, as in, a sinning capacity. Also, someone refusing to bear something is not the same thing as them being incapable of doing so, especially with God's help. (If he chooses to provide it when asked.) Who says he does (or has done) nothing? Second, like I said, we should all be in Hell, so the question is not &quot;why is bad thing X happening&quot; when the question should be &quot;why aren&rsquo;t I in Hell right now&quot;. None of us are good people having bad things happen to us. We are bad people with whom God is being patient. Again with the caveat &quot;God knows suffering isn&rsquo;t good so he will end it for his people&quot; as he is not a masochist. He has also demonstrably tamed evil many times in the past (hence the many commands to &quot;remember&quot; what he did in the Old Testament, and also, of course, Christ).</p>

<p>(I received no further response. This does not necessarily indicate an admission of incorrectness.)</p>
