<h1>THE PRINCIPLE OF AND EVIDENCE FOR CHRIST</h1>

<p>The much maligned and misunderstood conversation between Thomas and Jesus, from John 20:24-31: &quot;Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, 'We have seen the Lord.' But he said to them, 'Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe.' Eight days later, his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, 'Peace be with you.' Then he said to Thomas, 'Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe.' Thomas answered him, 'My Lord and my God!' Jesus said to him, 'Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.'&quot;</p>

<p>The detractor says: &quot;That passage always sort of rubbed me the wrong way, even as a kid. 'Blessed are those who believe blindly and aren&rsquo;t critical, and screw you for demanding evidence,' it&rsquo;s really not the best message to put out there.&quot; But that's not what Jesus meant. He was saying it's commendable that the other Apostles believed the promises Christ had made and accepted his return. Thomas did not believe those promises (&quot;I'll never believe&quot;). 1 Peter 1:8&ndash;9: &quot;Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory, obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.&quot;</p>

<p>People misrepresent Thomas, they misrepresent the people who misrepresent Thomas&#8230; but more importantly, they also completely misrepresent Christ's response.</p>

<p>I have discussed in large part the whole narrative and motive of God in Scripture, and covered the why of Christ. But I have not defended the evidence for Christ himself, for his existence, crucifixion, and resurrection. It's time to discuss this most important subject. After all, if Christ did not exist, if Christ did not die as described, if Christ was not raised as described, we are hopeless fools, worthy of nothing but pity. I should add that this chapter is a different color than the others. This chapter weaves many things, from geology to calendar studies to ancient letters together for one purpose: to showcase the evidence for Jesus Christ and his resurrection. This book used to have a chapter or two dedicated to archeology and the like for the Old Testament, but I have since removed them because in actuality, there is but one event we need to be certain happened. That is the betrayal, murder, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  Additionally, I have been asked many times how it is that someone can pick from the multitude of gods and religions that exist in the world. Ignoring for the moment the many, many pantheons that can be eliminated by observation (the mere fact that nothing drags the Sun across the sky invalidates a tremendous number of them), I reply that this is actually asking the wrong question. One needn't disprove all of them but one - instead, you only need to prove one religion as correct for all the others to necessarily be false, so long, of course, as that religion's truth falsifies all others.  One primary defense of Christianity's truth is prophesy. If there was a prophecy in Scripture that was so exact, and so precise, as to not be possibly human-created or randomly correct, that then came true, that would be an incredible piece of evidence for God's existence.  One contender for such a prophecy is that the book of Daniel predicts the exact month Jesus would be killed. Let's get this straight: modern critical scholars, in an effort to avoid Daniel's uncomfortably accurate predictions about Alexander the Great, despite the author's intimate knowledge of Babylonian courts, have dated Daniel to at least hundreds of years prior to Jesus even being born. We have copies from at least then as well, so there is no claiming that Daniel's prophecy was delivered after the fact for this.  Daniel 9:25-26 is where we find the prophecy. It says (in the NIV, for the ESV makes an interpretive &ldquo;translation&rdquo; here and calls the &lsquo;sevens&rsquo; &lsquo;weeks&rsquo; &ndash; more on that in a little bit): &ldquo;&rsquo;Know and understand this: From the time the word [command] goes out [is given] to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there will be seven &lsquo;sevens,&rsquo; and sixty-two &lsquo;sevens.&rsquo; It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of trouble. After the sixty-two &lsquo;sevens,&rsquo; the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> So let's do the math on that: first, it says &quot;Seven sevens plus sixty-two sevens&quot; will pass from the time the command is given to rebuild Jerusalem until the Messiah dies. So that's 49 (7 times 7) plus 434 (62 times 7) equals 483 years.  483 years though is just a number of years; we need a &ldquo;from when.&rdquo; Fortunately, we&rsquo;re told when to start the countdown: when the command is given to rebuild Jerusalem. Nehemiah 2:1-6 states that King Artaxerxes of Persia gave the order in his &quot;twentieth year&quot;, which was 445 BC, in &quot;the month of Nisan&quot; (the Hebrew month corresponding to our March and/or April). &ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;but why then? Couldn't this be referring to any number of times and Nehemiah doesn't exclusively apply?&rdquo; In short, no. Jerusalem was only destroyed once before 70 A.D., and that's why Daniel was in Babylon to begin with. See 2 Kings 25:8&ndash;10 (or really, the whole chapter) for the relevant section detailing the destruction. That's how we know which instance Daniel is talking about: he's talking about his own experience of a destroyed Jerusalem, and it only happened the one time in the Old Testament. So this calculation isn't being done with moving targets that are lined up to make the math work out a certain way; there was one destruction of Jerusalem, and one command to rebuild it. It has been attacked and fought over, by my count, about five times in the Old Testament record; but only once was it destroyed. I'll say it again, that one destruction was why Daniel was an exile, and that was the destruction he was talking about in his work. So not only was there only one destruction, it had specific relevance to Daniel. Alright, so we can reasonably give our start date for the 483 years: 445 BC.  Further, how do I know &quot;sevens&quot; are years? The same word is used here in Genesis 29:27-28 (word italicized): &quot;'&#8230;Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years.' Jacob did so, and completed her week.&quot;</p>

<p>This is part of the story of Jacob, who had served Laban seven years to earn Rachel, but was deceived and given Leah instead. Note that Laban said 'another seven years,' and then it is called her 'week,' and uses the same exact Hebrew word (italicized) as Daniel does in the prophecy. Thus, it can refer to years.  So, knowing this, we can calculate exactly when it's saying the Messiah would die. From the command being given to rebuild Jerusalem to the death of the Messiah is 483 years. 483 years after 445 BC would get us 38 AD, but we need to convert the date, as the calendar Daniel was using was slightly different from ours. Our calendar has 365.25 days, while the Babylonian one Daniel was using had 360 days. Daniel was a high-ranking Babylonian administrator and prophet. For administrative and prophetic purposes, the Babylonians used a 360 day calendar. Babylonian documents illustrate this clearly. According to David Brown , in Babylon &quot;A period of 360 days, comprising 12 months of 30 days each&#8230;was used extensively in administrative circles&quot;. His paper notes how this can be seen in a variety of Babylonian documents; for example, it talks about a work order for 36 female workers to work for 12 years, totaling 12960 days. So 12960/36 = 360 days for each worker's year of work. And there is another order for 720 daily grain rations for 24 months, which would be for two years of 360-day years. Since Babylonian prophecy and Babylonian administrators used a 360 day year, we can be sure that this is what a Babylonian administrator like Daniel giving a prophecy would be using. Going back to the calculations, 360 days in the year times 483 years is 173,880 days. Using our number of days, 365.25, we find that this would be 476 years. 476 years after 445 BC is 32 AD. So according to the prediction, the Messiah would die in the month of Nisan of 32 AD. Alright then, let's see it! Luke 3:1 tells us that Jesus began his ministry &quot;In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar.&quot; Tiberius began to reign in 14 AD, making 29 AD his fifteenth year. Jesus' ministry lasted for three years, and then he was crucified. Since his ministry began in 29 AD, that means the year of his death would have been 32 AD. He died just before Passover, which takes place in the Jewish month of Nisan. So Christ died in Nisan of 32 AD, precisely when Daniel had said the Messiah would die. The very next thing certain people do is bring up some date conversion calculator they found online and go check Passover in 32 AD. The second thing they tell me is that the gospels all say that Passover started on a Saturday, which is only true, according to these online calculators that is, for AD 30 and 33. I wish I did not need to remind such people that the Israelites did not use our calendar, but it often seems that I must do so. Something you cannot do is convert a day in their calendar to ours, or vice versa, with day-precision accuracy. Normally this would be prime Special Article fodder, however I hear this asinine &quot;counter&quot; far, far too often, so it will remain in the body of this work. I will leave paragraph breaks if you need no convincing on this particular matter.</p>

<p>The first mistake being made in that argument is in assuming that the date of Passover was in any way fixed. During the Sanhedrin's time there were several factors that would result in its date being altered. This is reported in the Talmud, which says in Sanhedrin 11 that, among other things, &quot;A year may&#8230;be intercalated &#8230;where it is necessary either for [the improvement of] roads or for [the repair of] bridges, or for the [drying of the] ovens [required for the roasting] of the Passover lambs, or for the sake of pilgrims from distant lands who have left their homes and could not otherwise reach [Jerusalem] in time&quot;. It gives other reasons, such as &quot;on account of the premature state of the corn-crops; or that of the fruit-trees; or on account of the lateness of the Tekufah. Any two of these reasons [occurring together] can justify intercalation&#8230;&quot; So there wasn't a hard and fast date for Passover, which alone defeats any simple date conversions. The date of Jesus' crucifixion could vary depending on something like whether the ovens were dry that year! And even then it wouldn't be quite clear how much Passover would be delayed by, since the same source also states that &quot;An objection was raised: How long a period was intercalated in the year? Thirty days. R. Simeon b. Gamaliel said: A month? &mdash; R. Papa Said: [The matter is left to the judgment of the intercalary court:] if they wish, they may add a month; or if they wish thirty days.&quot; The day of Jesus' crucifixion could vary depending on whether the people in charge simply felt like adding exactly 30 days that year or not! As you can see, the matter could easily be very inexact. The mistakes continue, because those who give this Saturday argument convert straight from our Gregorian calendar to a Judean one (at best, usually it&rsquo;s the modern Jewish calendar masquerading as a Judean one); this cannot work. You would have to convert a Gregorian date to a Julian calendar date and then you could go to the Judean calendar. And you cannot even base such a conversion on the modern Jewish calendar, as that was only introduced in the 4th century, and we don't have all the details for the first century calendar and how exactly it functioned. So you cannot, I repeat cannot, nail down the date and day of week like that. Why? Because it was more based on observation, as opposed to calculation, prior to the 4th century, which only compounds the issue. For example, &quot;The molad [the time of the Moon&rsquo;s &ldquo;birth&rdquo;] occurs when the moon has moved far enough from this position that a thin crescent of its illuminated surface becomes visible, marking the start of a new Jewish month&#8230;The actual moment at which the moon becomes visible will vary slightly from the average molad, depending on the relative positions of the earth, moon, and sun to each other at any given month, where on earth the observer is standing, the length of twilight at given seasons of the year, and other astronomical variables.&quot; When those criteria would have been met varies depending on a number of things, as you can see.  So not only did the calendar date fluctuate, but when exactly Nisan was could vary depending on factors that are impossible to calculate today, like when observers in Jerusalem decided the Moon was newly visible. So again, in conclusion, there was not a hard and fast date for Passover. Even if you take into account the random astronomical and imprecise human observation uncertainties, you still have many confounding factors, factors that we cannot even begin to approximate, that prevent the successful conversion of our calendar to theirs.  I trust that resolves the issue: if anyone says that April 14th 32 AD was a Monday, or gives any other date in our Gregorian calendar, that date is absolutely meaningless in reference to the calendar that was actually in use at the time. I will repeat it again: a Monday in the Gregorian calendar could very easily have been any other day of the week in the calendar actually in use at the time. Therefore, such arguments as this are woefully inadequate in discrediting the Daniel prophecy.  Once, when I had this argument in the wild west of the open internet, someone said &quot;How do we know God gave Daniel this prophecy, and not magical fairies or aliens with supercomputers?&quot;  I replied with, &quot;If you would like to believe that fairies with supercomputers gave Daniel a prophecy about Jesus Christ, if that's sincerely an option on the table for you, go for it.&quot; Sometimes the best response to nonsense, is more nonsense.</p>

<p>So, to recap, we have Scripture telling us the year and month a man whose great grandfather hadn't even been born would die. Nearly five hundred years. Five hundred years ago, there was a Holy Roman Emperor. Five hundred years ago, Christopher Columbus had just idiotically declared he &quot;discovered&quot; the Americas.   Moving along, there is one other prophecy I wish to discuss about Jesus, one that is recorded in Isaiah 52:13-53:12. This prophecy is unique in that it portrays someone who suffers for sin as a guilt offering, after being rejected. It has many interesting parallels with the life and death of Christ. The first thing to note is that Isaiah 53 definitively pre-dates Christ: the Dead Sea Scrolls, copies of Old Testament works from the BC era found in the 1940s, include one that is an entire copy of Isaiah, including Isaiah 53. However, ever mindful of counter-arguments, I would like to establish that Isaiah 53 is indeed a prophesy concerning the messiah, and not all Israel as modern Jews and many others claim. Now, you might ask, &quot;Why are you talking about the arguments around something before telling us the something?&quot; Because as you read the prophecy I'd like you to be aware of the traditional and most popular challenge to Isaiah 53. Sometimes, it is best to learn about the battle before you learn about the treasure it was fought over, and the biggest competing interpretation of Isaiah 53 is that it refers to all Israel instead of a specific individual.  I believe the summary of this from The Suffering Servant: Isaiah 53 in Jewish and Christian Sources says it well: &quot;The passage [Isaiah 53] was not only read and interpreted; it was also interpreted messianically [emphasis original]. Nevertheless, the passage's influences in early Judaism is not all of the same type, nor of the type that would necessarily support the preaching of early Christianity &#8230; Nevertheless, the demonstrated uses and echoes of this text are enough to suggest that traditions of suffering and atoning eschatological messianic figures were current in Palestinian Judaism.&quot;  A few examples of temporally relevant interpretation of the passage as messianic have been put in a footnote. They are not in the main body, because it is not interpretation but the text itself that is important. Back then as today, interpretation of Scripture has never been in lockstep across all readers, and even if no one understood Isaiah 53 to refer to a future messiah, that would not invalidate the interpretation by itself. (To take a silly reductive example, if I write &quot;one plus one equals two,&quot; and it is universally accepted that I meant that one plus one equals four, it doesn't change the words I wrote.) Thus, rather than see who said what about Isaiah 53, let's instead look to the best evidence that it does not concern all of Israel, the text itself. (Note that when I say &quot;Suffering Servant,&quot; that is the common term used to refer to the figure in Isaiah 53.) Here's a list of the largest differences: 1. The Suffering Servant is blameless. (Israel is admonished for her sins many, many times, including by Isaiah in Isaiah 58.) 2. The Suffering Servant dies. (Israel does not die.) 3. The Suffering Servant bears the sins of many. (Israel does not bear anyone else's sins, Israel is at most a light for others.) 4. The Suffering Servant suffers silently. (How many times are Israel's lamentations when suffering recorded in the Old Testament?)</p>

<p>These are, to me, the largest differences, though there are a number of others. Next, we have this verse from Isaiah 11:10: &quot;In that day the root of Jesse, who shall stand as a signal for the peoples&mdash;of him shall the nations inquire, and his resting place shall be glorious.&quot;</p>

<p>This verse is clearly messianic; Jesse is the father of King David (1 Samuel 16:5-13). We know that, of course, Jesus was descended from David's line, and Revelation 5:5 makes the connection explicit. Now, with that 'root of Jesse' image in your mind, look to Isaiah 53:2: &quot;For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground;&quot;</p>

<p> The root connection is obvious. I would argue that universally, where Isaiah describes the 'root', he describes the Messiah. As usual, there are many volumes written on the argument both ways, and I encourage the interested reader to find them and read them. I personally find the above satisfying enough, and so we will continue. Let's see the prophecy, or rather a summary of it; I strongly recommend you read Isaiah 53, because I intend to continue as though you are baseline familiar with it. There's a lot, so I'll rattle off what it says about the Suffering Servant, or Messiah, and while not all are overly specific, many are eyebrow-raisingly so: 1. 53:3 says he was despised and rejected by men; this frequently happened to Jesus. 2. 53:4 says he would be &quot;esteemed stricken&quot;, as in, rejected by his own people; it is no secret that Jesus was rejected by the Jews.  3. 53:5 says he was &quot;pierced for our transgressions&quot;; unless the gospels are lying, they report Jesus being pierced by a spear upon the cross. 4. 53:7 says he didn't open his mouth in the face of affliction and oppression; the gospels record Christ refusing to answer concerning his charges after being beaten and mocked. 5. 53:9 in part says they &quot;made his grave with the wicked&quot; - he was crucified with two criminals, where he died. 6. 53:9 also says he was buried &quot;with a rich man in his death&quot; - Jesus was laid in the tomb of a wealthy man by Joseph of Arimathea. 7. 53:9, finally, says that he had done no violence and there was no deceit in his mouth. The gospels record Pilate and the Jewish officials failing to find any actual crime he had committed, and, of course, he did not resist his arrest.</p>

<p>Take note that Isaiah wrote this probably seven hundred years before Christ was born. I have seen people try to refute this as applying to Christ by referencing verse 10 : &quot;When I read the part where it says that 'he shall pro-long [sic] his days' and 'he shall see his offspring', I knew that it did not refer to Jesus.&quot; That first point only makes sense if you start from the position Christ certainly did not rise from the dead, which is circular reasoning.  For the second point, &quot;offspring&quot; is really the wrong English word there. The original Hebrew, zera, can mean human offspring, sure. It can also mean seed, see Genesis 1:29, among other things. The point is, if you try to say &quot;this means whoever Isaiah 53 is talking about had children!&quot; you cannot make that argument with any degree of certainty from the Hebrew.  Further, no one sees the word &quot;crushed&quot; in 53:5 and takes it to mean he must be literally crushed; therefore we need not take every single word literally. Indeed, that would be generally unwise when reading prophecies from the Old Testament. However, if you're about to go write a review on Amazon or wherever and say &quot;this dude just arbitrarily decides when things are literal or not when it suits him,&quot; I have in fact written an entire Special Article arguing for, very specifically, why it is acceptable to interpret crushed in a metaphorical manner and why pierced is to be taken literally; that entry is Special Article E. Again, in the case of &quot;offspring,&quot; a long digression is not necessary since the Hebrew word simply does not exclusively or even mostly mean &quot;human children.&quot; Oh and, I should mention it refers to &quot;prolonging his days,&quot; which is not something Israel can do, but the resurrection is something Jesus did. I don't really use that as part of the evidence for the prophecy, though, since it demands you accept Jesus as a resurrecting messiah to defend the prophecy as being about resurrecting messiah. But I digress. The prophecy is best rendered as referring to the future suffering of the Messiah. It captures details about that event, to which some could be said &quot;well of course a guy you predict is going to die by his people's hands is going to be rejected by his people,&quot; while others, such as the piercing or the tomb of the wealthy man, are much harder to dismiss. Further, a fair few of these were beyond the influence or control of the man himself, and indeed several were also beyond the influence or control of his followers as well.  Personally, I find the Daniel prophecy to be far more compelling and effective when used against adversaries to the faith. After all, Jesus was fully aware of this chapter in Isaiah, he even quoted from it and by his own admission did things to fulfill it. But I am always asked for proof-positive of the divinity of Scripture, and I would say that predicting not only the exact month an event takes place, but also describing it in precise detail, could only be indicative of divine orchestration.  It might be useful to compare these two to a prophecy I chose not to include. see Psalm 69&rsquo;s twenty first verse: &ldquo;They gave me poison for food, and for my thirst they gave me sour wine to drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now anybody who has read the account of the crucifixion will recall the bit about the sour wine, and thus many say this is a prophecy of Christ. Of course it is &ndash; but you can&rsquo;t defend that to an outsider. The only possible defense is circular: Christ drank sour wine so the reference to drinking sour wine refers to Christ. Again, it is a prophecy of Christ, but I would never use it as evidence in an argument for Christ being the Messiah or the divine inspiration of Scripture. See the difference between that and Isaiah? Isaiah is specific both in terms of who it refers to and what happened. Psalm 69 is a handful of lines with no way to limit their application to any one person.  Here's something else about that is compelling about Daniel and Isaiah, though, is that in Jesus' lifetime, they did not have the knowledge of Babylonian court functions that we do. They had no idea that Daniel's prophecy referred to Nisan that year, which can be reinforced by the gospel writers' own lack of understanding concerning Christ&rsquo;s preferred title, Son of Man. If Jesus was just a man, where did he get the cuneiform samples necessary to translate, where did he get the Babylonian court documents to then translate, to figure out they used a 360-day year? Where would he have gotten the idea to do that in the first place? He was a builder, not a linguist. The Jewish scholars of his day all assumed, at the earliest, a decades later date for Daniel's prophecy, specifically because they did not have that information.  So if a detractor asks, &quot;Didn't Jesus also delay his return to Jerusalem for the same reason, to make his death align with Daniel?&quot; My reply here is first that there's no way Jesus had access to a correct interpretation of the dating used in Daniel (this also goes for the authors of the gospels; they also did not have access to that information). Second, Micah 5:2 tells us the messiah will come from Bethlehem, which all evidence points to Christ having done so. So not only was Jesus born in the correct town, but all the circumstances of his life and death, that he could not have controlled specifically, line up with the prophecies. I will grant the detractor this, it is not impossible that he orchestrated it all! But it is also possible Pilate could have had him flogged and released; he might've been thrown in prison instead, like so many of his followers were after his death. All Jesus did was go to Jerusalem around Passover (and be antagonistic to the authorities, of course). Everything else was out of his hands. Upon reflection, editing this several years after it was originally written, I have another something to note for the sake of intellectual honesty. If you haven&rsquo;t heard about the Antikythera mechanism, I&rsquo;ll tell you in brief. In the early 20th century, sponge divers found a Greek shipwreck with a bunch of bronze artifacts, from possibly 205 BC. Long story short, one of those artifacts turned out to be an astronomical calculator of sorts, or perhaps a form of orrery, capable of predicting eclipses and the retrograde motion of certain planets, among other things. (To what degree of accuracy I do not know nor is it relevant.) What is relevant, though, is the supposition that the Greeks used Babylonian calculations in the construction of the device. While the connection is not ironclad, they could have used their own derivations, I will mention it nonetheless. Two points:  1. Babylonian records of eclipses would not necessarily contain the information needed to properly calculate Daniel's prophecy, nor would it be obvious that this was the correct calendar to use with the prophecy. For instance, Ptolemy had access to Babylonian records&#8230; translated into the Greek calendar. These would be useless. 2. The information being present in ancient Greece 200 years prior to Christ's birth is an incredibly tenuous connection; 200 years ago colonialism in Africa was just getting started and the industrial revolution was ongoing. The temporal and geographical distances have to be taken into account.  So while a minor point in my view, once I heard the information I was compelled to add it: it is not impossible the Babylonian calendar information did persist to Christ&rsquo;s time, but there is no evidence of such, and there certainly isn&rsquo;t any evidence that the Jewish scholars of the time had access to it, much less that they connected it with Daniel&rsquo;s prophecy.  Moving on, you would not be remiss in reminding me that I have not actually shown yet that Jesus did in fact exist and die where and when as described. Rather than rely solely on Scripture to be compelling, we must seek out hostile and indifferent sources that show he existed. What follows are short descriptions of the evidence we have from generally hostile sources. Please don't take this as a 'hurling the rain' tactic; I'm not trying to convince you by tossing out every citation I can find. There are entire books dedicated merely to the subject of Christ's existence and the authenticity of his crucifixion, so this section is to be taken as more of an introduction to the subject than a rigorous, cutting edge argument. Also, I don't plan to give much information on the people themselves.  Tacitus, a Roman historian and senator (a hostile witness ), mentions &quot;the Christ&quot; in his annals. He also described Christ's fate as being the &quot;extreme penalty&quot; (Perseus Under Philologic: Tac. Ann. 15.44). The precise words are supplicio adfectus erat, which means &quot;inflict the death penalty upon.&quot; Josephus, an important Jewish historian and friend to (Roman emperor) Vespasian's son Titus, mentions Jesus in his works: &quot;Now there was about this time Jesus&#8230; He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles. And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross&#8230;&quot;  The quote goes on, but some of it is argued as being a later addition by Christians. I tend to agree. He is suspiciously approving of Christ in the un-quoted portion, yet calls him the &ldquo;so-called Christ&quot; elsewhere. Regardless, even without the later additions, the parts where he confirms Pilate had him crucified has never been questioned as illegitimate, and indeed, there is no reason to think so. Frankly, I think the obvious later addition only makes it more legitimate: we can see what a nefarious actor adding something to the quote actually looks like.  Suetonius, yet another Roman historian, mentions Christianity, and specifically mentions Christ as the founder of this troublesome religion: &quot;Because the Jews at Rome caused continuous disturbance at the instigation of Chrestus, he [Claudius] expelled them from the city&quot; (Claudius, 25:4; note that in Acts 18:2 Luke mentioned this expulsion by Claudius). Chrestus is a misspelling of Christos, since that translates to the Hebrew 'Messiah'. Suetonius also said: &quot;Punishments were also inflicted on the Christians, a sect professing a new and mischievous religious belief&quot; (Nero, 16:2). Pliny the Younger, a Roman magistrate (among other things), references Christ directly in his letters, three times specifically as the originator of Christianity.  There are others, such as Mara Bar-Serapion, and Lucian of Samasota, who wrote letters discussing Jesus and his execution. Christ's existence and the evidence for his execution is excellent given the standards we have for other ancient events. I stand by this bold claim: someone who does not believe Christ existed will not be able to produce an argument that would not also simultaneously invalidate the existence of many other ancient persons, such as Alexander the Great. If someone tries to argue against the existence of Christ, ask them to apply that same standard to any other given ancient. If they refuse, then you know you are actually arguing against an anti-Christian bias. Thus, we can comfortably say that the man Jesus Christ existed, and was more likely than not executed by the Romans. You only really find terminally online weirdos arguing otherwise, though, or people who want to sell books to those same folks. Let&rsquo;s get to the more interesting stuff. There are some other miscellaneous attacks leveled against his crucifixion, and I shall cover some of them briefly. It is sometimes claimed, for instance, that it would take an Olympic athlete to carry a whole cross the distance Jesus had to carry his. Alright, let's see if that holds water. First off, it's unlikely the whole cross was carried: it was common practice for the victim to carry the horizontal part, the patibulum, to where they would be executed. But, how could a tortured Jesus carry even this much? Let's see relevant verses, and as an added bonus, resolve a supposed 'contradiction,' concerning who exactly carried it (John 19:16-17): &quot;So they took Jesus and led Him away. And He, bearing His cross, went out.&quot;</p>

<p>Matthew 27:32: &quot;Now as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. Him they compelled to bear His cross.&quot;</p>

<p>Here we see that the wounded Jesus didn't carry the patibulum the whole way, he &quot;only&quot; carried it to the edge of the city or a little past that. A perfectly healthy adult male then took the patibulum from there. This is common practice, and there exists ample evidence to support that this was a standard component of crucifixion; if &quot;olympic athletes&quot; were required, it wouldn't have been done. What about the darkness that occurred as a result of Jesus' death? Mark 15:33: &quot;And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour&quot;</p>

<p>For starters, it was not the product of a normal eclipse (this is a common mistake people make that also contributes to the calendar misunderstanding). Fortunately, there are hostile sources for us to use to back it up, since we can't trust Christian ones alone to report on the darkness, as they had motivation to lie. So we have three hours of total darkness, which means people around Jerusalem and elsewhere should have seen something, and some of them should have written it down, and some of that writing should have survived until today, right? A man named Thallus, a historian covering the eastern Mediterranean since the Trojan War, wrote about the darkness, and while we've lost his writing (from about 52 AD), someone else named Julius Africanus referenced him around 200 AD, quoting him to disagree with the cause of the eclipse: &quot;Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away the darkness as an eclipse of the sun&mdash;unreasonably as it seems to me.&quot; Thallus was a hostile source, and Africanus is arguing with him about the cause of the darkness, not whether or not it occurred. Africanus himself was a convert, so we cannot precisely trust his words; however, we can more reasonably trust his quoting the man Thallus to disagree with him, since that is not Africanus' testimony, and the work was available when he quoted it to whoever he was writing to. Phlegon was a Greek historian, and wrote the following sometime around 137 AD (again, being quoted by an apologist later): &quot;In the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad [29 AD to 33 AD, so within our time frame] there was 'the greatest eclipse of the sun' and that 'it became night in the sixth hour of the day so that stars even appeared in the heavens. There was a great earthquake in Bithynia, and many things were overturned in Nicaea.&quot; This one nicely corroborates the time of day, even. Note that Phlegon is not a Christian, and does not mention Jesus; he was using records other than Christian sources, which lends legitimacy to the argument. Tertullian, a second century apologist, appeals to the records the Romans and others held in their own archives with regards to the darkness: &quot;At the moment of Christ's death, the light departed from the sun, and the land was darkened at noonday, which wonder is related in your own annals, and is preserved in your archives to this day.&quot; It is unlikely he would have made this claim if it were not known or verifiable that the archives held such documents. The first rebuttal I hear is often this: &quot;why didn't Josephus, Tacitus, Suetonius or others record the darkness?&quot; However this is an argument from silence; we cannot know why they didn't, or know for certain that they didn't, so it makes no sense to conjecture about it, and even less to rely on that as evidence. Further, they almost certainly thought it was a regular eclipse, and thus not worth commenting upon &ndash; the same as other eclipses. As for the earthquake that occurred in conjunction with the darkness, an article published in the International Geology Review, titled &quot;An early first-century earthquake in the Dead Sea&quot;, says this: &quot;To analyze earthquake activity in the region, geologist Jefferson Williams of Supersonic Geophysical and colleagues Markus Schwab and Achim Brauer of the German Research Center for Geosciences studied three cores from the beach of the Ein Gedi Spa adjacent to the Dead Sea. Varves, which are annual layers of deposition in the sediments, reveal that at least two major earthquakes affected the core: a widespread earthquake in 31 B.C. and a seismic event that happened sometime between the years 26 and 36 AD.&quot;  Which gives us evidence for the earthquake occurring within the appropriate time as well, and corroborates Phlegon, lending additional legitimacy to his statement. One piece of evidence corroborates both at the same time. King Abgar of Edessa, a small kingdom, wrote a letter to Emperor Tiberius about the matter. (Note I am not referring to the obvious forgery. If you google this, you're going to read primarily about the forged letter. Let me say this again: they are not the same letter. I offer defense of the letter after relaying its relevant contents.) First off, Abgar was a convert to Christianity, yet he was not, and could have not, been familiar with the gospels since they were written after his death (he died in 40 AD, or thereabouts). Here is the relevant portion of the letter: &quot;Abgar, king of Armenia, to my Lord Tiberius, emperor of the Romans, greeting: I know that nothing is unknown to your Majesty, but, as your friend, I would make you better acquainted with the facts by writing &#8230; Be assured that these are not the effects of the power of a simple mortal, but of God. During the time that they were crucifying Him, the Sun was darkened, the earth was moved, shaken&#8230;&quot; Abgar would not have reported this to Emperor Tiberius if he was not fully convinced it were true, so we have a contemporary of Jesus who wrote about it directly. In the first sentence after the greeting, Abgar says that Tiberius has certainly already heard of the events he is describing, but Abgar just wants to relate all the facts as he knows them. This is a serious confirmation of the fact that this was a well-known event, that Abgar is confident that the Emperor knows about it.  What follows is my defense of this important text. There are two letters that we know of. One of them purportedly records a message from Abgar to Jesus, and Jesus back to Abgar. There are those who argue tooth and nail for the authenticity of this conversation (my brother among them!), but I do not. As far as the authenticity of this second letter goes, I will relay the following: Eusebius (a later apologist) records the almost-certainly-forged letter from Jesus to Abgar, but he does not record the letter between Tiberius and Abgar. Since Eusebius didn&rsquo;t know about it, this means that the source for these two letters was different, and we can reliably separate the forged Abgar-Jesus correspondence from the Abgar-Tiberius letter. The Abgar-Tiberius letter left some traces in a work by a scholar known to us as Moses of Chorene, and a Syriac work called Transitus Mariae. I&rsquo;ll rely upon the work of Illaria L.E. Ramelli, a scholar in Roman Near Eastern History: The Possible Origin of the Abgar-Addai Legend: Abgar the Black and Emperor Tiberius. She argues that the Abgar-Tiberius letter is correct whenever it references historical events, which would not be the case for a much later Christian forgery (this paragraph is a summary of her argument). For instance, Tiberius needed the support of kings near the Parthians, and Abgar had just risen to power following an usurpation, and needed legitimacy; the letter appeals to both of these historical facts. In his reply, Tiberius recorded he had deposed Pilate, and indeed, Lucius Vitellius had in fact deposed Pilate (noted by Josephus). Lucius Vitellius is recorded by Moses of Chorene, and he (Lucius) is known to have been in control of Palestine at the time. Further, in the letter, there is a mention of the &quot;Children of Spain.&quot; If that referred to actual Spain, it would have been an anachronistic tell-tale sign of forgery. However! In actuality, this demonstrates great awareness of the political situation of the appropriate timeframe. The &quot;Children of Spain&quot; are the Iberians of Caucasian Iberia, or Georgia.  I recommend reading her whole paper if you find the Abgar-Tiberius letter to be still in doubt, but in short, it reflects the actual state on the ground in the 30s AD quite well, and is far more believable than the Abgar-Jesus correspondence. Again, I find the presence of an obvious forgery to only lend credence to the actual thing; for two reasons. One, it means Abgar was a known, prominent figure. Two, it shows you what a later forgery looks like and what it lacks.  Let me restate the Abgar-Tiberius letter&rsquo;s importance: it means we have strong evidence that the Roman Emperor was aware of the darkness and earthquake. He seems to have believed they were from another source, however, and Abgar was trying to correct his understanding. That&rsquo;s immaterial; what is important is that we can verify that there were no eclipses or regional volcanic events at the time, so we&rsquo;re left with few options for a regional darkness. Let&rsquo;s also not forget, Abgar was alive at the same time as Jesus, and this letter must have been written before his death around 40 AD. The darkness, the earthquake, and the crucifixion have thus all, given a reasonable standard of evidence for two thousand year old events, been shown to be plausible at the very least.  What about the empty tomb? The first thing to note is that women were the first to report it, in a hotly patriarchal society. If someone were trying to lie about the empty tomb, they would, in all likelihood, not have used women. Scripture itself even reports no one believing them. Of course, ancient critics often accused the Christians of stealing the body. Tertullian a famous apologist (who eventually became a heretic, I should add) writing in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, talked about the rumor of him being stolen away (in De Spectaculis). He said that Christ would mock those who said he was stolen from the tomb when he came back, which implies that this was a fairly widespread rumor.  The fact that there are only arguments about why the tomb was empty and not whether is important. That means that it is incredibly likely that the tomb really was empty. Looked at independently, the missing body isn't really impressive. It's like when someone tells me a ghost story: I don't care what they say occurred, I know there is a perfectly normal explanation hidden somewhere. The explanation put forth most often was and is that the body was stolen; it makes sense. But where ghost stories and Christ's body being gone differ is in the circumstances. I have thus far made the case that Jesus was a real person who was crucified, his death was predicted hundreds of years prior to the month, the details of his suffering were given in precise detail, there was an earthquake, and there was an inexplicable darkness. All of that taken together should force you to sit up and take the event seriously. A ghost story is going to be someone you sort of know telling you this he said-she saw nonsense with no corroboration but a few pairs of eyeballs. Here we have a vastly different arsenal of evidence and related materials. So, what of the resurrection itself? Understandably, evidence of this is hard to come by, and is limited to Scripture and some related materials. A large number of people came to believe that they had truly interacted with a resurrected Jesus. We know they genuinely believed they had, since the majority of them would be tortured and killed for their belief. Paul and James, zealous critics of Jesus (and subsequently his followers), also believed he interacted with them after his death, and died for it. The Bible isn't the only report on this. A Christian named Ignatius reported on the absolute belief of those who said they witnessed his resurrection (from To the Smyrneans, chapter 3): &quot;&#8230;after His resurrection&#8230;they touched Him, and believed, being convinced both by His flesh and spirit.&quot; To add to the list, Polycarp, Dionysius of Corinth, Tertullian, Clement of Rome, Origen, Celsus (notable Roman critic of Christianity)&#8230; all discuss the firm and unrelenting belief of the people who claimed they saw none other than a resurrected Jesus. Sure, these are largely Christians sans Celsus, but their testimony is nonetheless valuable as a report of what people believed, and some of them were fairly close temporally to the actual events. Mass delusion is really out of the question since the witnesses saw Christ on different days and at different times. Was it a mass lie? Possibly, but if so, it was such a lie that many who said they saw him were willing to be tortured to death for it. We have four accounts of the same events. Now, detractors will tell me, &quot;they're untrustworthy because of the contradictions.&quot; If I grant that there are contradictions, which I don&rsquo;t, but let&rsquo;s say I do - then all that does is cement that these are four independently researched and written narratives. That would mean that whatever they report in common was arrived at through independent efforts. And that&rsquo;s a whole lot of testimony about a 2,000 year old event. And if there aren't contradictions, that also helps the argument of legitimacy, since that means we have four independently researched and written chronicles that all report the exact same events, also a great sign of authenticity and veracity. Do you see how in either case, there are or are not contradictions in the gospels, the case for their being legitimate is strengthened? It's a catch-22 for detractors. Either they report the exact same series of events in remarkable detail, or they all report the same critical chain of events, which is the only set that matters, in chronicles written decades and distances apart. The Bible itself records Jesus' own brother James publicly challenging him, which didn't make either of them look good. Not having your family believe you, in those days, was particularly bad; thus, it lends additional legitimacy to the depictions of the resurrection sightings contained therein. Why? Because if someone is interested only in making something believable, they are more likely to leave out something as scandalous as his own brother doubting him. (Again, James numbers among those killed for his belief; he was eventually stoned to death for it.) So we have a large number of witnesses who clearly believed they hadn't seen a &quot;trick of the light&quot; or some such, and died for it. The likelihood that of all those who were tortured and died for claiming they witnessed the resurrection, and not a single one said that it was actually a big hoax&#8230; is low, to say the least. (I grant that it is not impossible, but we&rsquo;re coming to that. I should mention that we&rsquo;re told that some Christians did recant their testimony when called before Roman authorities. But there&rsquo;s a difference between later converts going &ldquo;you know I don&rsquo;t actually want to die,&rdquo; and people at the time saying they were included in a massive conspiracy. Perhaps records of such just didn&rsquo;t make it to us, but given how hotly the Jews contested the empty tomb, if there were former Christians who claimed it was a hoax we almost certainly would&rsquo;ve heard about it.) We know (or it is reported to us) that over 500 people saw him over about twelve different occurrences and up to about 40 days after his death. He ate and drank with them, talked with them, and they touched him on several occasions (again, as reported). So whatever occurred, they weren't deluded by some physical phenomena, they most likely can't all have been lying, and in fact would have easily been called out&#8230; &#8230;But, stopping rather abruptly, I think we all know where we have landed. I've stopped mid-thought to bring you back to awareness. It was, of course, inevitable: the end of the evidence. The thing is, you can argue and bicker about any given individual piece of evidence above; what happens, though, is that as you add each individual piece, it starts to paint a picture that is harder and harder to deny. When I put them all together, the Daniel and Isaiah prophecies, the earthquake, the darkness, the resurrection witnesses, the hostile testimony that he existed&#8230; the truth became clear to me, and I was well and truly convinced. Christ was no mere man of flesh and blood.  I leave the above with you for contemplation.</p>
