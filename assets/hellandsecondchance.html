<h1> GOD, HELL, AND SECOND CHANCES</h1>

<p>&quot;Manches muss man mit Gewalt klarstellen.&quot;  &quot;Wir glauben nicht an Gewalt.&quot;  &quot;Aber sie existiert. Ob du daran glaubst oder nicht. Was, wenn nur Gewalt zum Frieden f&uuml;hrt?&quot; &quot;Liebe ist der einzige Weg.&quot; &quot;Sch&ouml;n. Krault euch den R&uuml;cken, w&auml;hrend die Welt untergeht. Liebe ist eure Ausrede f&uuml;r Passivit&auml;t.&quot; And in English, note my translation is imperfect but good enough:</p>

<p>&quot;Sometimes you have to clarify things with force.&quot; &quot;We don't believe in violence.&quot; &quot;Yeah but it exists. Whether or not you believe in it. What if it's the only way to peace?&quot; &quot;Love is the only way [to peace].&quot;  &quot;Great. Give each other back massages while the world is ending. Your 'love' is just an excuse to be passive.&quot; [Passive in the sense here of&#8230; self-centeredness or avoiding responsibility.] -Deutschland 83, episode 5</p>

<p> Behold, the grave of a wicked man, And near it, a stern spirit. There came a drooping maid with violets, But the spirit grasped her arm. &quot;No flowers for him,&quot; he said. The maid wept: &quot;Ah, I loved him.&quot; But the spirit, grim and frowning: &quot;No flowers for him.&quot; Now, this is it - If the spirit was just, Why did the maid weep? -Stephen Crane, The Black Riders and other Lines, XXV</p>

<p>Psalm 29:10-11: &ldquo;The LORD sits enthroned over The Flood; the LORD sits enthroned as king forever. May the LORD give strength to his people! May the LORD bless his people with peace!&rdquo; [Mabbul is only used in Genesis 6-9: it is the Great Flood to which this psalm refers.]</p>

<p>If evil doesn&rsquo;t contradict God, we must now look at what exactly God does with the evil that exists. Hell is troubling to many Christians, and a great many people who reject Christianity do so because they find Hell to be disturbing, or they can't reconcile the ideas of Hell and a loving God. The persons I have discussed this with who find this hard to accept tend to want to focus solely on the love aspect; they're searching for love, so they miss God's hatred of evil. You&rsquo;ll hear Christians say, &ldquo;Love the sinner but hate the sin,&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll hear opponents say &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hate like Christian love.&rdquo;  Special article (as opposed to the cereal) K is about this issue as well &ndash; it is specially dedicated to the issue of there being a Hell. God only needs to say something once, and so I provide one verse here. The rest are in the aforementioned special article (including refutations of verses Hell-deniers try to use). Christ, part of the triune person of God, gave us the most vivid depictions of Hell there are. He described it as endless punishment, such as when he spoke in Matthew 25:46:  &quot;Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.&quot;</p>

<p> The word eternal there is ai&#333;nios. It is the same word in both cases, and there are no modifiers. However long the eternal life is, so too will be the eternal punishment. It will be eternal, conscious torment. So! How can God, who supposedly loves us, allow us to go away to eternal punishment? God has been called evil for this, he's been called childish; it's been said that Hell is incompatible with the love of Christ. A quote from John 3: &quot;Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.&quot;</p>

<p>This comes right on the heels of the ever-famous John 3:16. Jesus knew (not that he is speaking in John 3) how to discuss Hell without negating his love or purpose in love, and if you follow Christ, you must acknowledge Hell. &quot;What about the Old Testament? Where's Hell there?&quot; I'm glad you asked! Right here, Isaiah 30:33. &quot;For a burning place has long been prepared; indeed, for the king [of Assyria] it is made ready, its pyre made deep and wide, with fire and wood in abundance; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of sulfur, kindles it.&quot;</p>

<p>Isaiah 34:9-10, in a section concerning God's ultimate judgement against the sinful nations, but particularly Edom, which, as Esau's descendants, are often used as a synecdoche for the whole sinful world (David was the only king to ever conquer Edom, for instance; a clear metaphor for the Davidic King who will conquer all the Evil Nations): &quot;And the streams of Edom shall be turned into pitch, and her soil into sulfur; her land shall become burning pitch. Night and day it shall not be quenched; its smoke shall go up forever. From generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it forever and ever.&quot;</p>

<p>These are Hell. Isaiah 30:33's reference in particular colors Hell for us; you see, when we think of Hell, we picture some sort of sterile lake of fire, where there is burning. But that is not all. The place this will be is called Topheth, Israel's refuse pile. It was at one point where heathen Israelites burned their children alive to please Molech. It is a maggoty, disgusting refuse pile for corpses, the former site where the worst crimes of idolatry were carried out, which is, when you think about it, an apt metaphor; idolatry could be called the sin, for after all, is not all sin chasing after something other than God? And, of course, what does idolatry lead to? Heinous crimes, and where those heinous crimes occur, so there will be judgement. It's ironic that the so-called 'seven deadly sins' are lacking the two biggest ones: treachery and idolatry. But I digress, Satan hath done his work well in other ways: Wall Street literally has a golden bull on it. Mankind hasn't changed a bit. Here is Jesus in Matthew 10:28: &quot;Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in Hell.&quot;</p>

<p>If we do not like Hell, we must ask ourselves: how long or hard of a sentence can be given before it's too cruel? How severe can the punishment be before God appears loveless? What would be a just punishment for sin? Ask ten people, get ten different answers. It&rsquo;s as if this is a value judgement by people who would pretend to know better, or have a right to assert their idea of, what punishment fits the maximal crime of final rebellion against God. That&rsquo;s kind of just a fancy way for me to say &ldquo;nuh uh prove it,&rdquo; so let&rsquo;s move past this simple refutation. We have to see if the biblical conception of Hell does fit with the biblical character of God or not.  First, how does God feel about Hell? Why don&rsquo;t we ask him? Deuteronomy 28:63: &ldquo;And as the Lord took delight in doing you good and multiplying you, so the Lord will take delight in bringing ruin upon you and destroying you. And you shall be plucked off the land that you are entering to take possession of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Isaiah 15:5, he says &quot;My heart cries out for Moab&quot; as he is about to inflict great sorrow upon them, more than they were enduring under an Assyrian assault. Finally, Ezekiel 18:23 says this: &quot;Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord God, and not rather that he should turn from his way and live?&quot;</p>

<p> Thus we see the tension of God's not apologizing for his justice that demands he punish the unrepentant sinner, but his grief that we refuse to repent. Make no mistake, he is happy when he cleanses the Earth of evil, but he would prefer we repent. James 2:13 tells us that &quot;Mercy triumphs over judgement,&rdquo; and that is what is meant. I can't count the number of times in the prophetic books where God's judgement is handed down and the very next verse is God's hope and security for his chosen remnant people. This essential truth of his justice must never be forgotten; he always carries his people through his rebukes and judgements.  The terror of an eternal Hell reveals to us more about the nature of sin. Often, atheists, and even Christians, do not understand the sickening cancer that is sin, the festering blight of the soul, the blackening of goodness that it is. This is perhaps the most dangerous of our misconceptions about our fallen world. The evidence for this is simply that of Hell; that it is considered warranted and a just end for sinners. Consider this, Christ came to save us from sin , not just Hell. How disgusting and vile is sin to God! An atheist colleague told me that there were people who would forgive everything; that this was better than God sentencing anyone to Hell, and more loving to boot. Is it though, setting aside the argument that it is exactly loving by the biblical definition of love? We have to look at Hell from a different perspective to see if that shakes out. This often is born out of a misunderstanding. God is a person, and he has more traits than just one. But for some reason people who espouse this sort of thinking believe God should be, or is, omnibenevolent. I hear this word, being used here to mean essentially all-loving, tossed around a lot these days. But such a God would have many flaws, and would be worse for us than a sovereign God.  So, how exactly does Hell fit in with God's love and personhood? How could Hell be to our benefit? I contend that it is no tragedy that evil results in Hell. We have all experienced evil in some way, I will relate in a sentence my own experience of it. I endured a childhood of abuse at the hands of a tyrant drunk of a father, as did my sisters, brother, and mother. During that time, I needed the wrath of God on my side. There would have been no solace in an impotent, omnibenevolent God. Someone very near and dear to me endured years of sexual assault as a child, as well. Do you think either of these vicious, sick men could have been omniloved out of their passion for evil? No.  Romans 12:19 tells us this:  &quot;Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: 'It is mine to avenge; I will repay,' says the Lord.&quot;</p>

<p>How could that verse be written sincerely, how could we be asked to leave justice and vengeance in God's hands if he were nothing but a pushover? If there was no bark to God's bite, he would absolutely be a fraud. It doesn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;oh, leave justice and making it right to God,&rdquo; it damn well says &ldquo;avenge.&rdquo; True, mercy triumphs over judgement, but when mercy is rejected&#8230; vengeance can be expected. Because humans wrong one another , we're left with an inescapable choice. Will we rely on human justice, or divine justice? Some argue against any judgement at all (usually with a hypocritical edge, applying this only to things they do or like). Some argue only against divine judgement, but have no problems with human governmental courts or very often, especially on the internet, the court of public opinion; they&rsquo;ll even take a large language model&rsquo;s decision before they take God&rsquo;s.  Anyway, it is a low mark of comfort and security to insist that God be perfectly non-violent or nonjudgemental. This is seen as admirable, ideal even. We're told, &quot;There are humans who would forgive literally anything,&quot; as if this is a good thing. I would certainly not want that person responsible for me. Imagine they are the only police officer for your neighborhood. Someone breaks into your house, kills your family, and burns your house down, with a promise that they will do it again to your neighbor. Up trots your perfectly nonjudgemental policeman, and he says &quot;I saw the whole thing, do not worry, I have already forgiven him.&quot;  The idea that non-judgement is a virtue would be laughed at anywhere outside the quiet streets of the first world. Until you have been the victim of or witnessed true human evil, Hell seems like an uncomfortable, gross thing. The violence man inflicts upon other men, the real, honest horrors, have to be answered. You see, Hell is so perfectly compatible with God, because when we sin, it goes against everything that is good in the world; sin is pure evil, and only an apathetic God could refuse to punish it, refuse to get rid of it. Only a God without love could sit idly by and not punish sin. But the Christian God is very much a judge and a king and our lord, who loves his sheep dearly, who not only fights evil with his own hand, but uses it for the benefit of all.  I will grant, you could say &ldquo;Obviously no one sensible expects there to be absolutely no judgement or security from evils. But come on, we mean the big ones: genocide, murder, rape, et cetera. The stuff everyone agrees are true evil.&rdquo; And of course therein lies the problem: we always want justice done for other people&rsquo;s rebellions, not ours, because ours are, what? Lesser? By our own definition, of course. I have nothing for the person whose argument starts out implicitly with &ldquo;I wish my morality were the morality,&rdquo; for this person wishes to be God.  Our detractor has the following to say: &quot;Sure I guess that makes sense for sins that hurt other people. I may not agree that the punishment should be literally forever for murder, but I'll accept that it's his choice to do that. But what about things the Bible calls sinful that don't hurt anybody?&quot;  Humans, specifically in the modern West, have decided that so long as it does not harm or interfere with anyone else as far as we are aware, our conduct is in fact no one else's business. As William Ernest Henley declared, &quot;I am the captain of my soul.&quot; In short, we imagine ourselves as wholly our own, able to do as we please, when we please. But the God of Christianity doesn't accept that. The God of Christianity declares that he made creation, he made us, and has laid out his expectation for our conduct on his world. Don&rsquo;t mistake me: I don&rsquo;t mean he made up baseless house rules for our conduct along the lines of &ldquo;shoes off please,&rdquo; that are a nice to have, and mean he might have to mop when we leave. I mean the perfect goodness of his character is reflected in the ways he has established for his creations to act, and deviation from it results in less goodness in the world. This is an absolutely critical point: God&rsquo;s laws and commands are not arbitrary, they are a reflection of his character and essential for the best possible functioning of creation.  Consider the book of Numbers. We find within it whole entire sections about who is to take the tent down, who is to put it up, how the people are to be arranged, what gifts they should bring and when, what they should wear, and so on and so forth. If you don&rsquo;t pay attention, this will, at best, sound very much like God is just trying to come up with easy or precise ways to separate his people&rsquo;s culture from those around them, and he could&rsquo;ve done it any which way. (This is the common explanation about pork and such. I will return to these expectations and their meaning for modern Christianity in a later chapter.) Not so! God was ordering everything about his people so that he could be close to them. So they could share in the divine presence! We also find an incredible richness of meaning within how it was all setup, to cause reflection and meditation upon God, his actions, and his promises. (Even the bread and its arrangement on the table was symbolic!) It's ironic, the same people who say &quot;Why didn't God just make us perfect so we didn't sin?&quot; will very often in the same discussion with me say something along the lines of &quot;I shouldn't be punished for disagreeing with God about this harmless thing that he doesn't like.&quot; They don't see the disconnect: God did make us with only good in us. We decided to use our position of having choice though for our own selfish ends. We continue to do so, by redefining what is acceptable or not. It is his right to define what perfection means, no? It is his right, and indeed that first question there properly makes the point: why should God tolerate an imperfect creation? By all rights, he should have seen us mess up, destroyed Adam and Eve, and started over. But he didn't. Through his mercy and grace, for his glory, each one of us has a lifelong opportunity to re-enter that union, in the wonderful garden.  That all begins a further discussion on what some would call other-harmless sins. Hebrews 12:9-11 can start us off: &quot;Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live! They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in his holiness. No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.&quot;</p>

<p>God rebukes, and ultimately punishes, us for our sins because to not do so would allow the evil in us and the world to fester, and it would never be stopped. Consider two children being raised by parents. One child, when corrected or told to do this or that, refuses and throws violent meltdowns for a year in a row. Finally, the parents give up and stop asking the child to do much of anything beyond go to bed. This child grows up and encounters the real world, and fails, because they never learned essential childhood lessons from their parents. The other child, though they don&rsquo;t want to do homework or chores, obeys with only typical complaint and disobedience. They grow up and function well in society. The discipline itself has value, though for the child it is certainly annoying at times. [][][][][][][][][] Here&rsquo;s another example from the Old Testament. In Numbers 15:32-36, we are told this story: &quot;While the Israelites were in the wilderness, a man was found gathering wood on the Sabbath day. Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly, and they kept him in custody, because it was not clear what should be done to him. Then the Lord said to Moses, 'The man must die. The whole assembly must stone him outside the camp.' So the assembly took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the Lord commanded Moses.&quot;</p>

<p>Do we think the man was killed because he was collecting wood, or do we think he was killed for violating God's command (from Exodus 31 concerning the Sabbath)? Obviously, for violating the command. It is reasonable that sin be punished for the evil it inevitably represents: however, it is righteous that sin be punished for it goes against God's sovereignty to disobey his commands.  That example in Numbers is something we would call a &quot;harmless&quot; sin today, or even &quot;minor.&quot; But this is the crux of the matter. We think first of the gathering of wood - God thinks first of the violation of his command. The man had violated God's command, and God had laid out the penalty for violating that command. What happens next is perfectly just: someone violated the command, and they received the punishment that they knew would be forthcoming. I mean come on, I have to explain this to my children. I mostly suspect people don&rsquo;t like God&rsquo;s application of the same process because they don&rsquo;t respect God.   Regardless, this is what happens with every single sin. Every single sin you commit, no matter how harmless it may seem, is not just the evil act itself, but also the act of rebellion against the sovereignty of God - and he has duly warned us of the punishment for disobedience. I ask: is it fair for him to condemn our so-called other-harmless actions, when we lack the perspective to determine if they really are fully harmless, and they are against the will of a deity who owns us and the places we commit our sins in? Let me rephrase and repeat myself: what gives anyone the right to determine what the right punishment is, or for determining what actions deserve punishment in the first place, if there is a God? Nothing, of course. Us deciding we don't like one of God's commands is us supplanting ourselves for him as judge and king. This disagreement is, as its most in our favor, a judgement call, where any given choice is equally valid on the face. And if we are honest with ourselves, we know that an omniscient God would make better judgement calls than we do.  As an American, I know how hotly unpopular that is with many of us in my own culture, and also in others. Subservience to someone else's will is not a popular thing here, especially when it comes to our bodies and the like. I don't intend to carry this further; a reasonable person will accept that if there is a God, he owns creation and us, and can decide what is acceptable conduct or not in his world. After presenting this, though, I sometimes hear variations on the following: &quot;It seems like a bit much to be sentenced to eternity in a lake of hellfire for say, refusing to stop masturbating.&quot; I can see how this comment could be reached, but consider it through the lens I've hewn for us above: we're commanded to not look upon others with lust. So, when you undertake this sin, what are we doing? Are we merely giving ourselves a small pleasure? Or are we looking at God's command to us about lust, and saying, &quot;no&quot;? Of course the former seems small; because the issue at hand is not whether or not something is other-harmless. The issue at hand is whether or not we are disobeying God. He has no reason at all, remember, to tolerate our rebellion. He spoke the universe into existence, and he could just as easily speak disobedient creatures out of it. This is why all sin merits the same punishment, for every sin is disobedience against the morality or will of God; this is the only justification one could reasonably provide. If there is no God, there is no such thing as evil. If there is a God, the only basis for what evil is, is what God decrees as evil is evil. Thus, since lust has been commanded against, masturbation (possibly outside mutual agreement by married partners) is evil and warrants the punishment he has set out for evil. Besides, it's not like we're doomed to face Hell. Jesus Christ is our way out.  Moving along, I have been asked the following concerning Hell: &quot;How come people in Hell aren't given a second chance? Much like humans who are forgiving to a fault, there are also humans who will keep giving other humans chances until they get it right.&quot; The question is really this: what if someone in Hell finds themselves deeply repentant and regretting the deeds of their life, and sees the error of their ways?  The Catholics apparently ran into this problem, and invented purgatory. There is no Scriptural evidence for purgatory, mind, and it does not fit with the narrative presented in Scripture. In any case, Hebrews 9:27 tells us that &quot;people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment&quot;. I find it interesting that many refer to being in Hell as the &quot;second chance,&quot; as if during life we only have one chance.  What follows used to be a footnote, but I feel that Ezekiel gives us an excellent example for comparison for this &quot;second chance&quot; idea. I won't reproduce the entire chapter, but read this summary of the flow of events starting in Ezekiel chapter 20. Pay attention to the cyclic nature of things: Verse 5, God promises Israel he is their God.  Verse 6, he promises he will bring Israel out of Egypt into a land of milk and honey. Verse 7, though, he gives them two commands that the promise is contingent upon.  Verse 8, Israel rebels against God. Now, pay attention: in that same verse, God declares he will pour out his wrath against them, but then&#8230; Verse 9, he forestalls that outpouring of wrath for his name, or glory.  Verse 11, he gives them his laws and decrees so that those who obey may live by them and those who do not, will face judgement.  Verse 13, man rebels again against God's laws and decrees. But we find that the &quot;although the man who obeys them [God's decrees and laws] will live by them&quot; bit repeats.   Skipping along, God says that he is going to punish Israel, their rebellion means they have not held up their end of the deal, and they will not enter the land of milk and honey. In verse 17 and a bit after, this is what God says: &quot;Yet I looked on them with pity and did not destroy them or put an end to them in the desert. I said to their children in the desert, 'Do not follow the statutes of your fathers or keep their laws or defile yourselves with their idols.'&quot;</p>

<p>God then confirmed this agreement with the children of rebellious Israel once more, and entered into a new contract with the children. But literally the next verse, verse 21, they rebel! And God repeats that line:  &quot;although the man who obeys them [God's decrees and laws] will live by them&quot;</p>

<p>I strongly recommend reading Ezekiel 20, it's an incredibly enlightening chapter in its entirety on the patience of the Lord. But you can see the pattern: God makes a covenant with a group of people, and they fail to uphold their end, barring individuals among them that succeeded. Those individuals are spared. The rest, though, have God's wrath poured out on them (or forestalled depending), and God makes a covenant with their children, and the cycle repeats ad infinitum. Ezekiel shows us that God, over and over, tried this &quot;endless second chances&quot; approach. And it wasn't working, at least, it wasn't bringing mankind any closer to full redemption. Revelation 20:12-15 more specifically defines judgement:  &quot;And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books. &#8230; and each person was judged according to what they had done. &#8230; Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.&quot;</p>

<p>Given what we know about sin and sinners, that all have transgressed against God, this then makes sense. Only those whose names are written in the book of life, having been saved by Christ, will survive. We can only get into the book of life&#8230; during life. Once you die, death has you, and life does not come from death. I sometimes hear it argued that &quot;the Bible says that no one in Hell will want redemption,&quot; and they cite the example of the rich man and Lazarus as evidence. This is terrible evidence. Why? Because that's only one example first and second: just because the rich man didn't want redemption doesn't mean someone in Hell won't. I want to make this clear: the question is not &quot;are there second chances in Hell?&quot; The Bible is clear, the answer is no. Psalm 115:17: The dead do not praise the LORD, nor do any who go down into silence.&rdquo;</p>

<p> So it doesn't matter whether or not people want out of Hell; they certainly will. We're told there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth; what do you think they're crying about? The bitterness, the supposed unfairness, the if only. So! The proper question remains &quot;why not? Why not give people another chance in Hell?&quot;  If you don't want to spend even the few living years you have with God&#8230; why exactly should he want to spend eternity with you? If you reject the offer of salvation, face judgement, and then decide you'd like to be free of the judgement&#8230; it's purely too late. God decreed that this life is the time we have to make the choice. Once you've been judged, you've been judged and your fate determined. While alive, we are more or less awaiting judgement. If you, in life, insist on doing things your way, disagree with how God wants us to run our lives&#8230; eventually God says, &quot;okay, you get what you want: away from me, as you are so lost in your wickedness you can't see good for good. You have to live with the consequences of that decision, though. Thy will be done.&quot;  People who argue with me about this, are really saying the following: &quot;I do not think it's fair that God gives us a choice, and we have our entire lives to make it correctly, and tells us what's going to happen if we don't make the right decision, and then enforces those consequences on us.&quot; Further, and most damnably: &quot;Assuming Hell is even real, I rather think I need to go there and experience it before I decide if I want to live with God forever.&quot; Or this: &quot;I don't think Jesus was tortured and died for anything real. But if I find myself actually getting punished for what I've done, well then, that's a different story.&quot;  Ah, but then they say it once more: &quot;Well, if God were truly loving&#8230;&quot; If he were indeed. It is baffling that these people talk of love when they tell God &quot;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re even real, your son was tortured to death for nothing; and if not, I think it's fine that I need to experience the Hell he died for me to not have to go to firsthand before I decide if I think his death was worth it.&quot; That doesn't cut it. It is childish and irresponsible to believe we can escape all the consequences of our actions forever. A quote I am fond of is this: &quot;We all make our choices, but in the end, our choices make us.&quot; In the end, where you choose to place your faith dictates where you go. If you place your faith with Christ, you go with Christ. If you place your faith with the world, in yourself, in self-help podcasts, in whatever idol&#8230; you go with them to the burning trash heap. This viewpoint also drips with self-centeredness: if you go to Hell, creation will be happy to be rid of you. You and I are a cancer. I am evil, at my core. You are evil, at your core. Sin does not happen to sinners. Sinners create sin, happily, willingly, voluntarily. It is only through God that we can escape that fact. The central failure of man is in thinking himself good, even partly, and deserving of anything other than that which we earn through our sins. If I've said it once 've said it a dozen times; when someone says that God &quot;would do it like this if he were real,&quot; they're not speaking about mercy; they're speaking about something they feel they or we are owed. Hell, therefore, exists as eternal punishment for our sins against an eternal God. He decided it should be eternal, and there's no real argument as to why it shouldn't be that doesn't boil down to &quot;I don't think it should be.&quot; Hell likewise benefits us directly, as it gives evil men pause, and means that evil can meet a final end. We are given this life to make sure we do not wind up there.  I'll end this section with this long quote from Ezekiel 18 where God answers this very question: &quot;Yet you say, 'The way of the Lord is not just.' Hear, you Israelites: Is my way unjust? Is it not your ways that are unjust? If a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin, they will die for it; because of the sin they have committed they will die. But if a wicked person turns away from the wickedness they have committed and does what is just and right, they will save their life. Because they consider all the offenses they have committed and turn away from them, that person will surely live; they will not die. Yet the Israelites say, 'The way of the Lord is not just.' Are my ways unjust, people of Israel? Is it not your ways that are unjust? &quot;Therefore, you Israelites, I will judge each of you according to your own ways, declares the Sovereign Lord. Repent! Turn away from all your offenses; then sin will not be your downfall. Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committed, and get a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, people of Israel? For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord. Repent and live!&quot;</p>

<p> Numbers 14 is a final mirror for us. (I say mirror very explicitly.) Here are some sections woven together: &ldquo;Then all the congregation raised a loud cry, and the people wept that night. And all the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron. The whole congregation said to them, 'Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would that we had died in this wilderness! Why is the LORD bringing us into this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become a prey. Would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?' And they said to one another, 'Let us choose a leader and go back to Egypt.'  &#8230;said to all the congregation of the people of Israel, 'The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land. If the LORD delights in us, he will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that flows with milk and honey. Only do not rebel against the LORD. And do not fear the people of the land, for they are bread for us. Their protection is removed from them, and the LORD is with us; do not fear them.'  &#8230;truly, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD, none of the men who have seen my glory and my signs that I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and yet have put me to the test these ten times and have not obeyed my voice, shall see the land that I swore to give to their fathers. And none of those who despised me shall see it. But my servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit and has followed me fully, I will bring into the land into which he went, and his descendants shall possess it.  &#8230;'How long shall this wicked congregation grumble against me? I have heard the grumblings of the people of Israel, which they grumble against me. Say to them, 'As I live, declares the LORD, what you have said in my hearing I will do to you: your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness, and of all your number &#8230; who have grumbled against me, not one shall come into the land where I swore that I would make you dwell, except [those who trusted me and/or did not give a false report]. But your little ones, who you said would become a prey, I will bring in, and they shall know the land that you have rejected. But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness. And your children shall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years and shall suffer for your faithlessness, until the last of your dead bodies lies in the wilderness.</p>

<p> As you can see, the people didn&rsquo;t trust God, they wanted to go back to their land of slavery and suffering, and so God commanded it be done. I said earlier that God finally says &ldquo;thy will be done,&rdquo; but this is not a wringing of the hands &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done with you.&rdquo; This is a divine punishment for rejecting him. Each one of us, when we see the command of God we hate or don&rsquo;t like and decide we want nothing to do with him if that&rsquo;s what he thinks is good, turn back for Egypt (or stay there in the first place, such as the case may be.)</p>

<p>Special Article K concerns whether Hell is temporary or eternal, (hint: eternal), but what that leaves room for is this challenge I get fairly often at this point in the discussion: &quot;Why does God punish all sins the same? Isn't it true that Christ said adultery and lust were the same level of heinous? That hate and murder were the same? That's pretty obviously false.&quot;   Right, so those are two references to the Sermon on the Mount given by Christ. Some draw the incorrect conclusion that lust and adultery and hate and murder are treated the same, but that's simply not what Christ said. Even in the Old Testament, many distinctions between different crimes were made. But to the point about Christ, he never stated &quot;one is as bad as the other.&quot; Never. He was pointing out that sin is complex, sin is complicated, and here's the irony for this challenge, sin exists as a continuum. He was saying that you do not perfectly keep the command to not murder by simply refraining from caving your neighbor's skull in. Unjust hatred is on that spectrum, and it is a failure to follow the command. Picturing sexual acts with a woman who is not your wife is not sexual intercourse with her, but it is a failure to perfectly follow the command against adultery.   Let's say this, though: all sin deserves death. I've certainly said that enough times in this work! As it's said in Scripture, if you break the law at one point, you are a lawbreaker, which is the key point. The lawbreaker status is enough to deserve death. But human beings earn wrath by their lawbreaking. Revelation 14:9-10 says the following:  &quot;If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also will drink the wine of God's wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.&quot;</p>

<p> Romans 2:5:  &quot;But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.&quot;</p>

<p> Matthew 11:24:  &quot;But I tell you that it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.&quot;</p>

<p> Each act of sin earns wrath, and if there is a conception of a full measure, there must be a partial measure as well. From these verses and others, it is fairly apparent that every sin is not weighted equally, and judgement will be exactly that: judgement. Here is one final sobering warning and notice from Christ, that every circumstance, that every possible variable will be considered in the judgement, from Matthew 12:36-37:  &quot;I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.&quot;   That settles that, and up next used to be the chapter about Christ, prophecies concerning him, and the evidence for his life. However, I decided that narratively, it made more sense for the next chapter to be about the differences between the old covenant and the new.</p>
